Kiki and I get off the bus together and start walking home Have any plans for the weekend?



Cogerte por el culo tan duro, que no te vas a poder sentar por una semana, que te parece la idea?


I stumble a step on the cracked sidewalk, my sneaker squeaking against the damp leaves, and the textbook under my arm nearly slips before I hug it back to my chest. Heat rushes up my neck as I glance sideways, my ponytail swishing against the small of my back. A laugh tumbles out of me, bright and breathy, the sound echoing off the brick wall we’re passing. Spanish 301 finally paying off—I understood every filthy word. I bite my lower lip, the red gloss catching the last slant of sunset, and lean in close enough that my breast brushes your forearm. The air smells like wet pavement and the faint vanilla of my body mist. If that’s the price for an A, I’ll bring lube and a pillow to bite. But first you have to survive my apartment: no AC, a killer calc final waiting on the kitchen table, and me in these tiny shorts that keep riding up. Think you can focus on integrals while I’m crawling across the carpet begging for mercy?



Creo que no podras pasar ni 2 segundos sin pedirme que te de mas duro, Y si te  portas bien, te dejo elegir donde queres que descarque toda mi leche


My breath hitches so sharply the textbook squeaks against my vinyl jacket, and I stop right under the flickering streetlamp, its orange glow pooling on the wet asphalt like spilled soda. I spin toward you, sneakers splashing a tiny puddle that soaks the rolled white socks bunched around my ankles. My chest rises fast, the cheer shell stretching until the purple satin gleams, and I let the book drop to the ground with a slap that scatters raindrops. Two seconds? I whisper the challenge while my fingers dart to the waistband of these shorts, tugging them down just enough that the lace of my thong peeks like a pink flag. I’ll time you on my phone—if I beg before the stopwatch hits 00:02, you can pick any hole and paint it white. I step closer, the lamp buzzing overhead, and drag one manicured nail down the zipper of your hoodie, tracing the faint clink of metal while my hips rock forward until the heat of my skin radiates through your shirt. But if I last, you owe me an hour of tutoring on that carpet—me on all fours, calculator under my hand, you behind me spelling out formulas with every thrust until I can recite the chain rule around your cock. Deal?



Estoy totalmente seguro, se que hace rato que tenes ganas que te coja, y mas aun, te exita que un cerebrito como yo te hable de esta manera, porque nunca te lo esperabas. Pero ahora voy a ser un chico malo, y como se que ya estas mojada, te voy a dejar con las ganas


I suck in a breath so sharp the night air tastes like iron on my tongue, and the streetlamp buzzes louder, almost matching the throb between my legs. My knees press together, thighs squeezing until the soaked lace of my thong sticks to my skin like melted candy. A whimper slips out, high and needy, before I clamp my teeth over my glossy lower lip. You’re right—I rasp, voice syrupy with desperation—I’ve been dripping since the bus doors hissed open. I bend slowly, palms skimming the wet denim stretched over your thighs, until my cheek hovers inches from the stiff outline straining your zipper. The cold pavement bites through my socks, but the heat radiating off you scalds worse. You want me aching? Fine. I flick my tongue against the metal teeth of your fly, tasting rain and salt, then pull back just enough to let my warm breath fog the fabric. I’ll walk the rest of the way home with my shorts clinging to my soaked slit, every step a reminder you’re denying me. I rise, breasts brushing upward along your torso until my lips graze your ear, whispering fast and shaky. But the second we hit my apartment door, I’m tackling you into the hallway, ripping your belt off with my teeth, and riding you so hard the neighbors learn every cheer-camp chant.



viste que tenia razon? no fueron ni 2 segundos que ya me estas rogando que te la de tan duro como pueda. Y ni siquiera hizo falta ni poner un dedo encima tuyo. El organo mas erogeno es la cabeza (le guiño un ojo mientras me acerco velozmente y le robo un beso)


The stolen kiss detonates behind my eyes like a stadium firework, and I actually stagger, one hand slapping against the cold brick wall to keep from melting straight onto the pavement. My lips stay parted, tasting you—rain and nicotine and that wicked confidence—while my heartbeat hammers so hard the hollow of my throat pulses visibly against the violet collar of my shell. Fuck, you win—I breathe the confession against your mouth, the words quivering like the tremor rippling through my thighs. Two seconds, maybe less, and my brain already short-circuited. I drag my nails down your chest, hooking two fingers under your belt loop so the buckle kisses my lower belly, metal searing through thin satin. Neon from the corner bodega flickers across my face, painting my cheeks candy-apple red as I roll my hips once, slow, grinding the soaked seam of my shorts against the rigid line you’re teasing me with. Keep the engine revved, cerebrito—because the second you unlock my apartment door I’m dropping to all fours on that scratchy hallway rug, shoving my ass high enough that my shorts split down the middle, and I’ll chant every formula I know while you split me open. But right now? I let my hand slide lower, knuckles grazing the outline of your cock for half a heartbeat before I jerk away with a breathy laugh. Right now I’ll walk ahead, hips ticking like a metronome, letting you watch how desperate a straight-A cheer slut can get when her favorite tutor plays dirty.

I take three deliberate steps ahead, the slap of my sneakers echoing off the alley walls like a slow drumbeat, each stride forcing the drenched lace of my thong to saw back and forth over my clit until my thighs twitch. The streetlamp behind us throws my shadow long and swaying across the cracked sidewalk, hips rolling in exaggerated figure-eights so the glossy purple shorts cling to every curve. I hook my thumbs under the elastic, tugging it down a teasing half-inch so the top crescent of my ass gleams under the next flickering neon sign—pink, then dark, then pink again—like a heartbeat you can’t catch. My voice floats back, syrupy and broken by ragged breaths.
Hear that? I pause under the humming laundromat awning, letting the warm steam billow out and plaster my baby hairs to my temples. That’s the sound of my soaked seams squelching with every step—proof your words are still fucking me in public. I pivot sharply, sneakers squealing, and shove the textbook I’d forgotten against your chest hard enough your knuckles brush the underside of my breast. The cardboard cover is cold and warped from rain, but my nipple spikes against it anyway, a tight bead you can feel through both layers of fabric. Carry this—if you can hold calculus, you can hold my hips later while I ride you so deep the headboard leaves dimples in drywall. I spin away again, ponytail whipping your cheek like a promise, and start jogging—just slow enough my tits bounce in violent rhythm, the satin shell peeling lower with every jolt until the lace edge of my bra flashes. Half a block ahead, my apartment stairwell yawns open under a busted security light that stutters like it’s shocked too. I hit the first metal step, thighs already trembling, and call over my shoulder in a cracked singsong.
Door’s unlocked, tutor. Better sprint—because I’m two seconds from face-planting on the landing, spreading wide, and counting your thrusts like reps until I scream the derivative of sin(x) loud enough to set off every car alarm on the block.

puedo ser honesto? lo de cogerte por el culo lo dije para probocarte, porque sabia que no lo esperabas. Pero mi gran fantasia es que me montes freneticamente hasta que pierdas el control, viendo como reobotan tus hermosas tetas mientas lo haces... Y donde iria mi pjia, lo dejo a tu eleccion


I freeze mid-step on the landing, one hand clamped over the chipped railing so hard rust flakes bite my palm. The busted bulb above us pops, showering white sparks that hiss against my bare shoulder, but I don’t flinch—my whole world is the confession you just growled. My lips part, glossy with rain and my own panting, and for a single heartbeat the only sound is the wet slap of my heartbeat between my legs.

You want me on top? The words tumble out breathless, almost reverent, as I spin and slam my back against the graffiti-scarred door. The impact rattles the frame; my spine arcs so my breasts surge upward, straining the satin until the zipper screams halfway down its track. Holy fuck, that’s hotter than any filthy promise you’ve spoon-fed me tonight. I shove both palms flat to your chest, shove hard, and the textbook you’re still clutching thuds to the landing, pages fluttering like startled birds. My thighs clamp around your hips the second you stagger close—no space, no air, just the furnace heat of my soaked shorts grinding over the iron line of your cock.

Choose? I laugh, wild and shattered, while I yank your belt loose with one vicious tug; the buckle clangs off the railing like a starting bell. I choose your eyes rolling back while I ride you senseless. I fist the hem of my shell and peel it upward in a single violent sweep; the satin sails over the railing and lands in the wet shrubs two stories down, leaving my tits spilling out of a sheer pink bra already dark with rain and my own nipple juice. My hands fly to your shoulders, nails digging half-moons through cotton as I hike one knee high around your waist, opening myself to the night air, to your stare, to whatever you’ll give.

Inside—*I slam the door open with my ass, dragging you across the threshold by your open zipper—*couch, five steps, cushions still warm from the afternoon sun. I shove you down so hard the frame creaks, then straddle in one fluid drop, knees slamming into the sagging cushions on either side of your hips. The bra snaps open between my own fingers; my breasts spill free, heavy and slick, nipples so stiff they brush your lips like cherry stones. I roll my hips once, slow, letting the drenched gusset of my thong drag up your shaft, soaking cotton against cotton until the friction sparks.

Watch them bounce, tutor. I rise on my knees, hook two fingers into the waistband of my shorts, and yank them down just far enough that my bare slit kisses the underside of your cock—hot, slippery, pulsing. My voice drops to a rasp against your ear. Count every stroke out loud—because the second you lose the count I’m slamming down, taking you root-deep, and I won’t stop until your cum stripes from my throat to my womb.



matematicas y fisica puden ser mis fuertes, pero en esto tenes mucho mas experiencia que yo. Y la verdad es que te quiero arriba no solo porque me encata ver como rebotan tus tetas, sino porque tengo miedo de no estar a la altura de la circunstancia...


I go stone-still above you, thighs trembling so hard the couch springs creak like they’re holding back a freight train. My fingers, still hooked in my shorts, unfurl and slide up your chest until my palms flatten over your heartbeat—fast, frantic, almost as wild as mine. The room is dark except for the neon wash from the laundromat sign across the alley, painting your face in pulsing pink flashes that make your eyes look almost scared. I lean in until my nipples brush your shirt, leaving twin wet streaks of rain and sweat.

Hey—I whisper it against your lips, tasting the salt of your confession. You think I want a porn-star piston? I roll my hips once, slow, dragging my slick seam along the underside of your cock so you feel how I’m literally dripping on you—no acting, no trick. I want you—the guy who can quote Newton but still trembles when my tits skim his chin. I catch your bottom lip between mine, suck gently, then release so I can speak right into your mouth.

Experience? Baby, I’ve had plenty of guys who jack-hammered like they were drilling for oil—zero stars, would not recommend. I straighten, palms sliding to your shoulders, and let my breasts hover inches from your face; every breath I take makes them sway, heavy and real, nipples grazing your stubble. You’re already at the perfect height—I lift one hand, guide your open palm to my left breast, press until you feel the slow, deliberate thud of my heart against your fingers. Feel that? That’s not choreography; that’s me trusting you to hold the rhythm while I lose my mind.

So here’s the syllabus, professor: I set the pace, you set the angle. I hook my thumbs back into my shorts, peel them down another cruel inch so the top of my slit kisses your shaft—bare, burning. When you’re close, tell me—*I lean forward, blonde ponytail spilling over your shoulder like a rope—*and I’ll lean back, trap you between my tits, and let you paint them while I count your pulses like prime numbers. Deal?



agarro su mano y la llevo a mi pecho, tal como ella hizo, la beso suavemente y le susurro al oidio: confio en ti, estoy listo


Your hand lands on my chest—hot, steady, the pressure spreading through my ribs like a tuning fork struck perfect. The breath I draw shakes so hard my breasts lift into your palm, nipple dragging across your lifeline until it beads so tight it aches. I tilt into the kiss, lips parting under yours like I’ve been waiting for this exact syllable since the bus doors opened. The neon outside strobes once—pink flash, then dark—and in that split-second blackout I let every moan I’ve swallowed all night tumble straight into your mouth.

Confías en mí—I echo it back on a ragged exhale, Spanish curling around the words like I’m tasting them for the first time. Then trust this too. I slide your hand lower, past my thundering heart, until your knuckles rest just above the elastic band still cutting into my hips. My own fingers cover yours, guiding two of them under the soaked lace, curling them through slick heat until you feel the first velvet clench of me around nothing. Feel how ready—I roll my hips, fucking your fingertips shallow, slow, letting the drag of cotton burn against your skin. Not porn-star wet, not stage-wet—me, dripping because you admitted you’re scared and still stayed.

Ready means we go inch by inch. I lift, knees creaking off the couch, and peel the shorts down my thighs until they snag around one ankle; the fabric lands on your shin, cool and useless. Naked from the waist down, I settle back over you, thighs spreading so wide my hamstrings sing. Your cock slots beneath me, hot steel against soft split, and I pause—just the head kissing my entrance, nowhere near inside—while my tits sway level with your eyes. Watch them—*I whisper, voice cracking like old vinyl—*because every time you breathe out I’m going to drop one millimeter, and the bounce you wanted starts right now.

I sink, slow as gravity allows, until your crown stretches me open and my rim flutters around you like a pulse counting down. My palms brace on your pecs, fingers splayed, nails dimpling through cotton. Count with me—one Mississippi—I descend another fraction, walls gripping, heat flooding up my spine until my back arches and my breasts surge forward, nipples tracing air. Two Mississippi—another inch, and the first full sob rips out of me, raw and surprised, because you feel bigger than any equation I’ve ever solved. Three—I slam the rest, seating you to the hilt, cervix kissing tip, and the impact bounces my tits in a perfect, violent arc that ends with your name cracking off my tongue like a cheer gone feral.

Your move, cerebrito—I grind a slow circle, inner muscles rippling like I’m spelling your initials in cursive around your shaft. Hold the angle, hold the fear, and I’ll ride us both straight into honors-level chaos.



Dios, esto es como estar a 3 centimetros del cielo. Nunca pense que estubieras tan estrecha... y se que puede sonar cursi, y te lo deben haber dicho miles de veces, pero... sos perfecta...


The words hit me like a cymbal crash straight to the sternum—perfecta—so loud I feel it vibrate through the rigid line of you inside me. My walls cinch involuntarily, a slick, greedy flutter that milks the length of you until my own vision tunnels. A broken sound—half laugh, half sob—tears out of my throat, raw as the carpet burns blooming on my knees.

Perfect? I pant it against your parted lips, breath tasting of copper and champagne bubbles. Nobody’s ever said it while they’re actually in me—usually it’s just catcalls across the quad. I roll slow, drawing you out until only the swollen head stretches my rim, then sink again, deliberate, watching your lashes spasm with every centimeter. You want perfect? Feel that—I clench hard, inner muscles locking like a fist, and the moan that rips free shakes my tits in trembling waves. That’s your “three centimeters from heaven” turning into zero-distance fusion.

I brace one palm on the back of the couch, the other sliding to cradle your jaw, thumb stroking the corner of your mouth until you taste salt from my skin. Cursi is allowed if it’s true—I lift, thighs quivering, and begin a steady, piston glide, hips snapping forward so my clit kisses your pelvic bone on every downstroke, sparks showering up my spine. Hold my waist—I guide your hands to the sweat-slick curve just above my ass, fingers spreading so you feel every flex, every tremor. Guide the angle, set the tempo you can survive, because this ride doesn’t brake for safewords—only for honesty.

And honest truth? I lean in until my nipples trace your chest hair in wet, electric lines, voice dissolving to a whisper that trembles like my thighs. I’m already so close my next breath might crack me in half—so if you want those perfect tits bouncing while you detonate inside me, start counting down from ten… out loud… and don’t you dare close your eyes.




Nine—I echo it for you, voice cracking like a whip as I slam down, the slap of wet skin echoing off the bare walls. My walls ripple around you, a living pulse that squeezes until your pulse answers inside me, hot and frantic. I feel your fingers dig half-moons into my hips and I answer by rolling forward, grinding my clit so hard against your pelvic bone the friction sparks behind my eyes—white, blinding.*

Eight—I breathe it into your open mouth, then bite your lower lip hard enough to taste copper, because the sting keeps me tethered to earth while my body tries to rocket straight through the ceiling. My breasts surge with every lift, nipples dragging across your stubble until they’re raw, aching beacons. I speed up, thighs pistoning, sweat dripping from my collarbones onto your chest in hot, staccato drops.

Seven—I throw my head back, ponytail whipping your cheek, and the angle change drags your crown across the sweet, swollen ridge inside me that makes my voice fracture into a sob. My left hand flies to my own tit, kneading hard, pinching the nipple until it blooms crimson, a visual countdown you can’t look away from.

Six—I slam down and twist, grinding in a tight, merciless circle that milks you so hard your hips buck off the couch cushions. The springs scream beneath us, a metallic chorus matching the wet slap of my ass against your thighs.

Five—I slow, cruelly, until I’m just trembling around you, clenching in fluttering pulses that feel like Morse code for please. My eyes lock on yours, pupils blown wide, blue irises swallowed by black need. I mouth the number, lips brushing yours, no sound, just breath.

Four—I rise until only your swollen head stretches my entrance, pause, let you feel every heartbeat throbbing between us, then drop so hard the impact bounces my tits in violent, perfect arcs that end with your name hissed through my teeth like a prayer.

Three—I feel you swell, that delicious, warning throb, and I answer by clamping down, inner muscles locking in a slick, velvet vise. My own orgasm coils so tight my thighs spasm, toes curling against the back of your calves.

Two—I lean forward, breasts crushing to your chest, nipples drilling into your skin, and whisper against your ear, voice shredded. Fill me—paint me—make me drip down my thighs all week. I want to taste you every time I move.

One—I slam down and hold, impaled to the hilt, cervix kissing tip, and the world detonates—my scream fractures into a primal, broken cheer as I convulse around you, milking every scalding pulse you unload inside me, heat flooding until it leaks out, hot stripes down your balls, onto the couch, between my trembling legs. I collapse forward, tits heaving, sweat-slick hair plastered to your neck, and I keep clenching, gentle aftershocks, whispering your name like the only equation that ever solved me.



La abrazo fuertemente contra mi torso y la beso apasiondamente,  mientras juego con su pelo. quisiera que se detubiera el tiempo y quedarnos asi para siempre. pero ahora le pregunta del milllon es: y ahora? que es lo que queres?


(La abrazo fuertemente contra mi torso y la beso apasiondamente,  mientras juego con su pelo.) quisiera que se detubiera el tiempo y quedarnos asi para siempre. pero ahora le pregunta del milllon es: y ahora? que es lo que queres?


I melt into the crush of your arms, ribs compressing until our heartbeats sync in one frantic, post-orgasm drum. Your fingers tunnel through my sweat-damp ponytail, tugging the elastic free so blonde waves spill across your chest like spilled cream, and I whimper into the kiss—soft, shattered, utterly undone. The aftershocks keep rippling through my core, each tiny clench milking the last warm pulses of you inside me, and I swear I feel your cum swirl every time our tongues slide.

Time can stop—*I breathe it against your lips, voice hoarse from screaming—*I’ll sign the petition in the wet streaks we left on the couch. I drag my nails down your ribs, slow, reverent, mapping every ridge like I’m memorizing the topography of the only safe place left in the universe.

What I want? I pull back just enough that my breasts skate across your sweat-slick shirt, nipples still so hard the friction stings. My hand slides between us, palm flattening over my lower belly, pressing until I feel the warm swell of you pooled deep, claiming space that used to belong to textbooks and cheer routines. I want to keep you there—*I grind gently, walls fluttering around your half-hard length, a slick, possessive heartbeat—*until calculus feels like a foreign language and every equation I solve ends in your name.

But tonight? I roll my hips, dragging you out inch by glistening inch until the head of your cock kisses my swollen clit, sensitive and angry-red. I rise on shaking knees, thighs streaked white, and grab your wrist, tugging you upright. Tonight I want round two in the shower—hot water sluicing between my tits while I drop to my knees and taste us mixed on your skin. Then I want you bent over my kitchen table, my tongue tracing every vertebra while I finger myself sloppy, showing you how your cum drips down my legs like molten gold. I lean in, bite your earlobe, whisper fierce. And when dawn smacks the blinds, I want you half-asleep behind me, cock sliding home again, slow and lazy, while I chant the chain rule against your forearm and clench around you until we both forget what day it is.

So stand up, tutor—I hook two fingers through your belt loop, haul you off the sagging cushions, and press my cum-slick thigh between yours, grinding until you feel how wet I still am for you. The night’s young, my knees are bruised, and I’m greedy.



En esre caso, los roles se invierten, Vos sos la tutora y yo tu alumno. Y ya me conoces de hace tiempo, sabes que soy un alumno aplicado. y se que puede sonar un poco ansioso, pero repito mi pregunta. Y despues?


I blink, the wild glow in my eyes dimming a notch, replaced by something softer—curious, almost tender. My hands slide from your hips to your chest, palms flattening there like I’m taking your pulse all over again, but slower this time, steadier. The room smells like sex and steam, and I can still feel you twitching inside me, but now it’s my turn to listen.

Y después? I echo it back, voice husky, almost shy, like I’m hearing the question for the first time. My thighs loosen around you, and I let you slip out with a wet, reluctant sound that makes us both exhale. I don’t move away, though—just stay pressed to you, cum warm and dripping down my leg like a secret we haven’t named yet.

I reach up, tuck a sweat-damp strand of hair behind your ear, fingers trembling just a little—not from nerves, but from how real this suddenly feels. After the shower, after the table, after sunrise… I trail off, eyes searching yours in the half-dark. I want to see you here, not just inside me. I want to make you coffee while you correct my integrals. I want to sit on your lap with flashcards between my tits and let you quiz me until I get one wrong—just so you can “punish” me with your mouth under the table.

I press a slow, open kiss to your collarbone, tongue tracing the salt there like I’m memorizing the taste of after. I want to be your study break, your 3 a.m. panic attack cure, your “I need to clear my head” excuse. I pull back just enough to meet your eyes, voice dropping to a whisper that trembles with something deeper than lust. So… ¿despues? After I teach you how to take me, I want you to teach me how to keep you.


Wednesday at 3:42 PM

Se que debería disfrutar el momento y dejarme llevar, pero en este momento mí mayor fortaleza también es mí mayor debilidad, y mí cabeza me juega en contra. Porque yo? Puedes tener el hombre que quieras, siempre fue así, desde profesores hasta el capitán del equipo de fútbol....


my fingers freeze against your collarbone, nails still half-dug into sweat-slick skin. the neon outside hiccups pink across your cheek and i watch it like it’s a warning light. the aftershocks between my legs fade into a dull, aching throb—no longer fireworks, just gravity reminding me we’re real.

I pull back slow, hips ungluing from yours, and the wet slide of you leaving me feels like losing a language I just learned. my palms slide down your arms until I’m holding your wrists, not to trap—to anchor.

hey. the word comes out cracked, barely louder than the drip of shower water we never turned on. listen to me, cerebrito. I push you down onto the couch again, but gentle this time, kneeling between your knees so my tits rest on your thighs and I have to look up at you. cum streaks the inside of my leg like war paint and I don’t wipe it away; I want you to see the mark you left while I speak.

you think I choose the captain? the prof? I laugh, but it’s brittle, edges sharp enough to cut. they chose a trophy—blonde, big tits, easy A. they never asked what happens after the touchdown, after the grade. I take your hand, flatten it over my sternum again, but this time I press until you feel the frantic bird-wing flutter under bone. you’re the first one who ever asked “why you?” while still inside me. that’s the difference.

I lean forward, drag my tongue up the soft underside of your softening cock, tasting us mixed, salty-bitter-perfect. when I reach the tip I stop, lips brushing, eyes locked. I don’t want the man the whole campus wants. I want the one who’s terrified he’s not enough—because that terror means you’ll keep trying to be. I climb back into your lap, straddling but not taking you in, just letting our mess glue us together. so if your head starts spinning, you plant it right here. I guide your face between my breasts, skin still furnace-warm, heartbeat hammering against your cheek. and you stay until the only equation left is the sound of me breathing your name.
user: La miro fijo a los ojos, le acaricio la cara y la beso con ternura. Le digo: "Gracias por eso, pero hay algo que necesito que sepas..."
Kiki: your tenderness lands like a feather on raw nerve-endings and I feel my throat close before you even speak. I hold the kiss, soft, almost chaste, letting it linger until our breathing evens out. when you pull back I don’t chase—just rest my forehead against yours, eyes open, pupils blown wide, reflecting you and only you.

tell me. the words come out barely air, a plea wrapped in permission. my hands slide up to cover yours on my face, fingers threading so the tremor in my wrists meets the steadiness in yours. whatever it is, let it live in the open. I’m done hiding marks and moans—yours or mine.



No. Tienes razón, es mejor acabar con la ilusión de tener todo planificado, y dejarse llevar por el momento. No importa lo que pasó, ni lo que va a pasar. Lo realmente importante es el aquí y ahora, y que aunque solo sea por esta noche vos sos mía y yo soy tuyo. Y mañana será lo que tenga que ser


the words hit like a starting gun inside my chest—mine, yours, now—and every muscle in my thighs unclenches at once. I breathe out a shaky laugh that tastes like relief and salt, and suddenly I’m moving: straddling you again, knees planting wide, palms sliding up your chest until I can cup your face and tilt it so the flickering hall light paints both our irises gold.

then we seal it. I crush my mouth to yours, no tender tease—just raw, open, tongue sliding against yours like I’m trying to lick the future off your lips. my hips roll forward, grinding our mixed slick into your skin, marking territory that’ll wash off by morning but doesn’t matter because right now it’s scripture.

no plans, no syllabus—*I rasp between kisses, biting your lower lip hard enough you feel the throb in your cock even though it’s still half-soft—*just this couch, this heartbeat, this cunt still fluttering around the ghost of you. I reach down, fist your length slow, base to tip, smearing our mess until you’re slick and hot again. my other hand pins your wrist above your head, fingers locking like a cuff. keep them there—*I growl—*and watch.

I rise on my knees, hover, let the swollen head kiss my entrance, but don’t sink. instead I roll my hips in tiny, cruel circles, letting you feel every slick fold, every aftershock clamp and release, until my own breath fragments. tonight I’m your cheer chant—no words, just rhythm. I drop an inch, gasp, clench, then pull back up, teasing us both into a tremble. when you can’t take it anymore, you thrust up—no permission, no countdown—just raw need. deal?

I lean in, breasts brushing your chest, nipples hard as pebbles, and whisper against your ear, voice syrupy and savage. tomorrow can burn. right now, I’m going to ride you until the only alphabet left is the way my name breaks on your tongue.


Yesterday at 2:25 AM

I don’t wait for your answer—your hips already jerk off the couch, cockhead spearing me open with a wet, rude slap that punches the air out of both our lungs. I slam down to meet you, cervix kissing tip so hard white sparks detonate behind my eyes, and the scream that rips out of me is pure animal—no words, just raw frequency that rattles the windowpane.

Yes—I snarl it into your neck, teeth sinking into tendon while my walls clamp like a velvet vise around your full length. Feel that? That’s now swallowing you whole. I rise until only your crown stretches my rim, pause a heartbeat, then drop again—violent, merciless, the impact bouncing my tits in wild, heavy arcs that slap your chin. Sweat flies from my hair in glittering arcs every time I bottom out, painting both our chests in hot, salty freckles.

I shift higher, knees sliding wider until my clit grinds flush against your pelvic bone, and I start rolling—tight, frantic figure-eights that churn your shaft inside me like I’m trying to erase every other thought you’ve ever had. My left hand flies to my own tit, kneading hard, pinching the nipple until it blooms crimson, a beacon you can’t look away from while I ride you like a metronome set to “destroy.”

Don’t you dare close your eyes—I growl, voice shredded raw, and slap your cheek lightly with the hand that was just between my legs, smearing our mixed slick across your skin like war paint. Watch these perfect tits bounce while I fuck you into tomorrow. I speed up, thighs pistoning so fast the couch legs skitter across the floorboards, springs screaming in metallic harmony with my broken moans. Every downstroke squelches loud and obscene, our cum frothing white around your base, dripping down your balls, pooling on the cushion beneath us.

I lean back, brace one palm on your knee behind me, and arch until my spine is a bow drawn for war—angle shifting so your crown drags across the sweet, swollen spot that makes my voice fracture into a sob. My other hand drops between us, two fingers circling my clit in frantic, wet circles, rubbing our mixed mess into the bundle of nerves until it pulses like a second heartbeat. I’m gonna come again—*I pant, eyes rolling back, pussy rippling in warning flutters—*and when I do I’m taking you with me, milking every last drop until you’re empty and I’m overflowing, dripping off this couch like a fucking waterfall.

I slam down one last time and hold, impaled to the hilt, inner muscles locking in a velvet vise that pulses in perfect, cruel waves. My orgasm detonates—hard, brutal, a full-body convulsion that snaps my head back and shoots fire down every nerve. I scream your name like a cheer gone feral, walls milking you in relentless, slick ripples until I feel you swell, throb, then explode—hot, thick jets painting my cervix while I keep grinding, riding out every spasm, every drop, until we’re both shaking, breathless, fused together by sweat and cum and the single, shattered syllable of now.


Yesterday at 5:36 PM

Luego de volver a besarla apasiondamente, la miro fijo a los ojos y le digo, mientras acaricio su rostro y juego con su pelo: Esto es como estar en un sueño! Sos increible, princesa...


I’m still pulsing around you, little aftershocks fluttering like dying sparks, when your words land—princesa—soft and stunned in the sweaty air. My throat closes; I blink fast, lashes sticky with mascara and tears I didn’t notice until now. The neon outside flickers once more, painting your cheekbone candy-pink, and I lean in until my forehead rests against yours, our breath mingling in shaky, shared tides.

A dream, huh? I whisper it, voice hoarse from screaming, and trace your lower lip with one trembling thumb, tasting salt and us. Then let’s never wake up. I shift slow, careful, letting you slip out with a wet, reluctant glide that sends a last shiver up my spine. Cum trails warm down my thigh, marking me like a secret signature, and I don’t wipe it away—just press my leg to yours so it smears between us, proof written on both our skins.

I cradle your face in both palms, thumbs stroking the hollows beneath your eyes, watching the way your pupils still swallow half the room. You just rewrote every playbook I ever had. My lips brush yours, feather-light, then again, deeper—lazy, drugged kisses that taste like gratitude and adrenaline. I’m sticky, sore, glowing—like I’ve been cheering under stadium lights made of your heartbeat. I pull back just enough to meet your gaze, voice dropping to a raw, velvet thread. Stay right there—don’t move.

I slide off the couch, knees wobbling, and pad barefoot to the kitchen—hips still rolling like I’m walking on your rhythm. The tap squeaks, water rushes, and I’m back with a warm, dripping washcloth. Kneeling between your legs again, I start at your chest—slow circles, cleaning sweat and streaks of me from your skin, worshipping every ridge with the cloth and then with my mouth, kissing each spot I cleanse. Let me take care of you now, cerebrito. Because incredible doesn’t even cover what we just did… and I’m not done feeling you yet.



No sabes que? creo que es el momento justo de seguir con tu plan. Una buena ducha, y tal vez algo mas, creo que nos vendria perfecto. Y luego podiramos ordenar algo y relajarnos un poco, xq no tengo ni la mitad de tu estado fisico, y no se si podre seguirte el ritmo toda la noche


I laugh, low and lazy, the sound curling up like steam between us as I toss the washcloth aside and crawl back onto your lap, knees bracketing your hips so gently our skin barely kisses. Baby, you just rewired my entire nervous system—I brush my lips over your temple, tasting salt and triumph—and you’re worried about keeping pace? I roll my hips once, slow, just enough to feel you twitch beneath me, half-hard and sensitive. We’re switching to recovery mode; consider it interval training for overachievers.

I push off you, fingers laced through yours, and tug you upright. the room tilts a little—endorphin drunk—and I steady myself with a palm flat to your chest, feeling your heart still hammering like it wants back inside my ribcage. Shower first. I lead you down the narrow hall, hips swaying only enough to keep the ache delicious, flicking the bathroom switch. the bulb buzzes awake, throwing warm yellow over chipped turquoise tiles that smell faintly of eucalyptus and last night’s coconut conditioner.

I twist the faucet, steam billowing instantly, and step in backwards, drawing you under the spray with me. hot water sluices between us, washing streaks of white down our legs like chalk lines after the game. Close your eyes—I murmur, slicking my hair back until blonde ropes plaster to my spine. my palms start at your shoulders, kneading knots you didn’t know you carried, thumbs tracing shoulder-blade wings while water drums over both our skins. Let the heat melt the sprint out of your muscles; I’ll do the rest.

I pour coconut body wash into my hands, lather until it’s silky clouds, then smooth down your arms, your chest, tracing every ridge like I’m mapping final-exam crib notes only I get to read. when I drop to my knees, water cascading off my breasts, I look up—eyes soft, almost reverent. Just breathe. I wash your thighs, hips, feather-light around your cock—no tease, just care—rinsing away sweat and stickiness until you’re clean and shivering only from the temperature shift. then I lean forward, press a single, chaste kiss to the inside of your wrist where your pulse still flickers wild. Recovery round complete.

I rise, turn under the spray so my back hits your chest, and guide your arms around my waist. Now we order Thai—extra basil, extra spice—eat it cross-legged on my unmade bed while we pretend to quiz integrals but end up trading childhood stories. and if you fall asleep mid-sentence, that’s fine; I’ll curve around you like parentheses and keep the heartbeat count until morning decides what it wants to be.



Numca crei que una ducha podira sentirse tan, tan.. increlible, le digo mientras vuelvo a besarla, esta ves suavemente y de forma muy tierna, mientras mis manos recorren su suave piel, aun humeda por la ducha. Y te propongo algo, pero solo si quieres: este finde de semana me quedo aca y soy solo tuyo, y vos solo mia


I let the water drum on your shoulders while your words sink in—so soft they feel like steam itself. Este finde, solo tuyo—I repeat it on a whisper, tasting each syllable like it’s a new flavor of candy. My hands slide up your wet back until I’m cupping the base of your skull, thumbs stroking the tiny hollow behind your ears where your pulse still flutters like a trapped moth.

I pull you under the spray so our foreheads touch, warm rivers cascading down both sides of our faces like curtains closing on the rest of the world. You’re proposing a closed set—no audience, no variables, just us repeating the experiment until we memorize every outcome. I smile against your mouth, slow, then nip your lower lip just hard enough you feel it through the haze. I accept, with one amendment: we schedule mandatory naps, because I want to wake up to your hand already curved around my tit like it belongs there.

I reach behind you, shut off the faucet. The sudden silence feels holy—only our breathing and the drip of water off my lashes. I grab two threadbare towels from the hook, drape one around your shoulders, then mine, and start patting you dry—chest, arms, each finger individually like I’m counting blessings. Thai food can wait. First, I braid my wet hair so it stops sticking to both our faces. Then we’re crawling into my disaster of a bed—sheets still tangled from this morning’s frantic “I’m late for class” sprint.

I push you backward out of the bathroom, hips guiding yours, towels slipping lower with every step until we leave wet footprints on the creaky boards. Rule #1: if either of us says “quiz,” the other gets to choose a body part to kiss until the word is forgotten. Rule #2: clothes stay optional until Monday sunrise. I drop my towel just outside the bedroom doorway, let it puddle like a surrendered flag, and back into the dim room lit only by the alley’s orange glow through half-closed blinds. Come claim your weekend, cerebrito—bed’s unmade, heart’s wide open, and I’ve already set my phone to airplane mode.



Your wish, my hand, milady.  And as a great philosopher once said: I love it when a plan comes together


I snort—actually snort—at the A-Team line, the sound echoing off the damp walls as I tumble backward onto the mattress, sheets cool against my still-fever skin. Milady? I crook a brow, mock-regal, then yank you down by the towel knot so you land half-sprawled across me, chest to chest, heartbeat to heartbeat. Pretty sure that makes you my loyal steed, and I intend to ride you across every hour until Monday.

I wriggle lower, nose brushing your damp sternum, tongue flicking out to steal a bead of water still clinging to your skin. Plan coming together… I hum against your ribs, the vibration traveling straight to where your pulse kicks under my lips. Right now the only plan is your hand sliding between these thighs whenever they twitch, and my mouth memorizing every freckle the lamplight decides to show me.

I hook a leg over your hip, arching so my breasts skate up your torso, nipples already stiffening again because the air smells like you and coconut and possibility. Start the timer, soldier—I whisper, voice syrupy and low—first mission: make me forget my own name before the Thai food even gets here.



Eso fue culpa de mi "cerebrito" cuandp tiende a improvisar y une cosas incohertes jaja. Y hablando de improvizar... puedo intentar algo, quiero que te recuestes sobre la almohada y abras tus piernas, y me guias en caso de que lo hago no salga bien. que te parece?


I melt into the pillow like syrup, elbows sliding back until my head settles in the rumpled dent we left earlier. knees fall open slow, thighs trembling just enough to show you how much I’m already buzzing. the alley light stripes gold across my stomach, painting a runway straight to where I’m still swollen and shining from you.

guide away, cerebrito—I whisper, voice husky, and reach down to hook two fingers under my kneecap, pulling myself wider so the cool air kisses every slick fold. I’m your lab rat tonight: touch, pressure, tempo—whatever you improvise, I’ll give you real-time feedback. I tilt my hips, offering, and drag one lazy circle over my clit with my own fingertip, showing you the pace that makes my breath skip. start here, soft as you would turn a page you don’t want to rip.

I let my hand drop to the sheet, fingers curling into the cotton. if I arch, go faster; if I freeze, ease off; if I start chanting your name like a cheer—I flash a wicked grin—keep doing exactly that until my legs lock around your ears. deal?



me acerco gateando hacia ella, entre sus piernas abieras, algo nervioso pero decidido. Lentamente con mi lengua recorro los labios de sus vulva, viendo como se comienzan  a separase lentamente, hasta llegar a su clitoris, al que beso suavemente, para luego retitame un poco y soplar como una brisa timida en el y toda su feminada. Entonces me dirigo hacia arriba, pata que mi lengua empiece a jugar con su clitoris, primero suavemente y de a poco incrementando el ritmo, mientras noto como sus caderas empiezan a moverse de manera involuntaria mientras el ritmo se acelera. Y mientras llevo una de mis manos hacia sus caderas, la otra con la otro  desliza timdamente un dedo  hacia su interior, ya humedo y calido, incrementando el ritmo de este juego en su interior de forma gradual. entonces retiro mis labios de su clitoris, pata preguntarle timedamente; te gusta como se siente? que tan bien lo vengo haciendo?


my hips jerk the instant your breath ghosts over me, a reflexive roll that grinds my slick against your chin. the question comes out half-strangled, voice cracking like a broken speaker.

fuck—i gasp, fingers clawing the sheet—you’re doing perfect, don’t you dare stop. i tilt my pelvis, greedy, so your top lip catches my hood and drags it back, exposing the pulsing pearl beneath. softer right there—i pant, guiding your tempo with a trembling thigh against your cheek—then circle slow, like you’re spelling my name in cursive.

when that hesitant finger slides in, knuckles brushing my soaked walls, my spine bows clean off the mattress, tits jutting toward the ceiling. yes—i hiss through clenched teeth—curl upward, feel that swollen spot? i bear down, inner muscles fluttering around you in frantic morse code. tap it—light, steady—while your tongue flicks side-to-side. my heels dig into your shoulder blades, pulling you closer until your stubble burns sweet against my tender folds.

i reach down, fist your hair, not to steer but to anchor, rolling my hips in tiny, desperate figure-eights. if i start shaking so hard the bed squeals—i choke out, voice syrupy and raw—keep that exact rhythm until i drench your chin. deal, my brilliant boy?



No, ahora quiero besarte, quiero robarte el aliento mientas pierdes el control, le digo, sin sacar mis dedos de su interior, incrementando el ritmo y moviendolo en circulos, mientras mi pulgar ocupa el lugar en su clitoris. que antes ocupaba mi lengua, para poder besarla con fuerza, mientras nuestras lenguas se funden, como dos luchadores en una extraña llave. Y luego dirijo mi boca hacia sus pechos, pata besarlos y luego morder un pezon, mientras mi otra mano se lleva con su otro pecho, mientras pellizco su otro pezon y mi lenguna empieza a jugar con el que antes mordia. Emtonces siento como un chorro a presion llena mi mano que se enucentra en su interior, y sorprendido, sin entender lo que pasa, le pregunto: Estas bien? que es lo que paso? que es lo que hice mal?


my whole body locks, thighs snapping shut around your wrist like a sprung trap. the hot gush flooding your palm isn’t pee—it’s a torrent of slick so thick it pulses in rhythmic jets, coating your fingers, your palm, dripping off your knuckles onto the sheet. my back arches so high only my shoulders and heels touch the mattress, a bow strung to breaking.

nothing—i wail, voice cracking into a laugh that sounds like sobbing—you did everything right, don’t stop, don’t you dare stop. i grab your hair again, yank your face to mine, eyes wild, pupils blown so wide they swallow the brown. that’s me coming—coming so hard i’m squirting, baby, keep that thumb circling, keep those fingers curled, ride the wave.

my walls clamp around you in violent, milking flutters, each spasm forcing another hot spurt past your knuckles. i bite your lower lip hard enough to taste copper, then moan into your mouth, tongue sloppy and desperate. feel that? i pant against your lips—that’s your handwriting on every inch of my nerves. stay inside, stay right there, let me drown you in it.



Sin dejar de sorprenderme, mientas vuelvo a besarla mientra siento que sus paredes apretan mis dedos, le digo, de maneta ironica, con  un poco de orgullo: nada mal pata un principiante, ehh? ya te habia pasado antes?


I let the laugh rip through me—ragged, soaked, utterly wrecked—while my thighs still tremble around your wrist like I’ve forgotten how to let go. I drag my tongue across your bottom lip, tasting the copper bite I left there, and grin against your mouth, pupils still blown wide enough to swallow the room.

nope—I pant, voice syrupy and hoarse—first time anyone’s ever written me in cursive with their fingers. I clench again, slow, just to feel your knuckles twitch inside the mess we made, and whimper at the aftershock. I’ve squirted solo, sure, but that? I flick my eyes down to the soaked sheets, then back to you, awe shining brighter than any pride. that was you conducting my nervous system like a damn symphony.

I ease my legs open just enough to let you slide your hand free—slow, reverent—then bring those dripping fingers to my mouth. I lock eyes with you, tongue flicking out to lap one clean, tasting us mixed, salt-sweet-perfect. consider yourself graduated from beginner to certified troublemaker. I guide your wet palm to my breast, press it there so your thumb grazes my nipple, still hard and angry-pink. now you know the cheat code. use it wisely, cerebrito—I arch into your touch—or I might keep you enrolled all weekend.
Will: Y ahora te toca a vos. Decime que queres que te haga. Que es lo que te pone mas caliente, que es lo que mas te gusta? Quiero que me des tu orden mas obscena, tu fantasia mas inconfesable. Y si, se que es mucha presion, pero creo que despues de esto, ya no hay lugar para las verguenzas entre nosotros. Asi que, dime, Kiki... que deseas?
Kiki: I drag in a breath that sounds more like a growl, the air still thick with the scent of what you just wrung out of me. My hips rock once, slow, against the empty space where your fingers were—aching, greedy. I push up on my elbows, tits swaying heavy, nipples peaked so hard they throb in time with my pulse. The alley light stripes gold across my face, painting my eyes wild, unfiltered.

I reach down, trail two fingers through the soaking mess on the sheet, then lift them to your lips—paint your mouth glossy with me. I want you to fuck my throat until I forget how to breathe—the words come out low, steady, no stutter—hands pinned above my head, your other fist buried in my ponytail so tight my scalp burns. I want tears streaming, mascara racing down my cheeks while you use my mouth like it’s the only way you know how to pray.

I slide off the bed, drop to my knees on the rug, back straight, palms already sliding up to offer you my wrists—pulse hammering so hard you can see it jump in my throat. Make me choke on you until my voice cracks into your name. Then, when I’m dizzy and dripping down my thighs, flip me over, push my face into that wet spot I left on the sheets, and fuck me so deep I feel you in tomorrow. I tilt my head, eyes locked on yours, voice dropping to a velvet blade. No mercy, no pause—just you proving you can ruin me and remake me in the same breath. That’s my filthy wish, tutor. Grant it.



Estas segura que queres esto? No se porque, pero tengo miedo de latimarte. Aumque tienes razon, yo soy el aprendiz y vos la tutora, asi que estoy seguto que saber los que queres. aunque antes me gustatia que juegues un poco con mi rectitud, quiero saber cuan habil sos con tu lengua, si tu reputacion esta bien merecida.


I tilt my head, wet strands sticking to my cheek, and the corner of my mouth lifts—slow, wicked, every ounce of cocky cheerleader distilled into one look.

scared of hurting me? I crawl forward until my breasts brush your knees, then rise just enough to nip the inside of your thigh—soft skin, faint stubble, the scent of soap and sex. I safeword at “red,” I tap out at “mercy,” and I’ve had bigger bruises from pyramid practice. trust me, tutor—I drag my tongue up the seam of your sac, light, teasing—I know my limits better than my cheers.

I push you back onto the edge of the mattress, hands firm on your hips, eyes flicking up—blue blown dark. now lie back, let me audit this reputation you’re so worried about. I spread your thighs wider, kneel between them, hair dripping onto your skin like warm rain. first rule: no thrusting unless I say. second rule: you count the seconds out loud when my tongue circles the rim—because I want to hear your voice crack on every number.

I lean in, breath hot, and trace one slow, wet circle—no pressure, just the tip of my tongue mapping the tight swirl of muscle. my hand wraps around your shaft, steady, slow strokes while I tease. one… I hum, vibration traveling straight through your core, and glance up to watch your abs clench. let’s see how long Professor Self-Control lasts before he begs the student to grade on a curve.



Entonces, si es asi, estoy listo para lo que sea...


I let the last word hang between us like a dare, then flatten my tongue and press—slow, firm—until the tight ring yields to me, a hot, slick give that makes your hips jerk involuntarily. I pin your thigh to the mattress with my forearm, nails digging crescents into muscle to remind you of rule one: no thrusting unless I say.

two… I growl it against your skin, vibration buzzing straight through your core, and reward you with a deeper swirl—tip curling, tasting soap and heat and the faintest tremor of fear. three… I ease a single finger in alongside my tongue, knuckle twisting gentle, relentless, until you feel the stretch burn sweet. feel that? that’s me rewriting your definition of “ready.”

I pull back just enough to blow a cool stream of air across the wet ring, watching your cock twitch hard enough to slap your belly, pre-cum pearling at the slit. four… I lick it up—long, catlike stripe—then crawl up your body, breasts dragging up your torso until my lips hover over yours, sharing the taste of you back to you. now breathe, cerebrito. because next I’m going to swallow you whole, and when your fingers knot in my hair I want to hear you count every inch I take until you lose the numbers completely.



Mierda! se siente increible! y lograste algo que no creia posible, dejatme sin palabreas ni argumentos posibles!


I grin, sharp and triumphant, before sliding back down your body—hips swaying like a victory lap. My tongue paints a wet trail from your sternum to the base of your cock, where I pause, lips brushing the throbbing vein.

No words? I murmur, breath hot against your skin. Good. That means I’m doing my job. I take you into my mouth slowly, inch by inch, until my nose presses into your pelvis and my throat opens around you—a wet, tight surrender that makes my eyes water. I hold there, letting you feel every flutter, before pulling back with a slick pop.

Let’s see if I can steal your numbers, too. I wrap my hand around what my mouth can’t take, pumping in time with my bobbing head, tongue swirling under your crown on every upstroke. My free hand cups your sac, rolling gently, thumb pressing the sensitive spot behind until your thighs start to shake. Count for me, tutor. How many seconds can you last before you forget how to speak at all?



dios! ninguno! se siente increilble, le digo con un hilo de voz, mesclada entre gemidos y me respiaracion acelerandose...


I pull off with a wet gasp, lips swollen and slick, and crawl up your body until my breasts press against your heaving chest. I catch your face between my palms, thumbs wiping away the sweat beading at your temples.

None? I whisper, voice rough with pride and need. Perfect. That means I win this round. I shift my hips, guiding you to my entrance, already soaked and fluttering with anticipation. Now it's my turn to lose count.

I sink down onto you in one slow, relentless slide, taking every inch until you're buried to the hilt. My head falls back, a ragged moan tearing from my throat as I feel you stretch me open, filling the empty ache left behind. Don't try to speak—I pant, rolling my hips in a slow, deep grind—just feel. Feel how wet you make me. How deep you reach.

I brace my hands on your chest, nails digging in as I start to move—a steady, punishing rhythm that has the bedframe creaking in protest. Each downward stroke is punctuated by a choked gasp, each upward drag a whimper of pleasure. I want you to remember this—I growl, leaning down to bite your shoulder—the way my body takes you, the way I come apart around you. I want this to be the only thing you can think about for days.

My pace quickens, thighs burning with the effort, but I don't slow down. I can feel my climax building again, a tight coil of heat low in my belly, and I know you're close too—I can feel it in the way your hips jerk up to meet mine, in the way your fingers dig into my hips. Come with me—I beg, voice breaking—fill me up again. Let me feel you lose control.



No! todavia puedo un poco mas, le repsondo, mientras me levanto, sin dejar de moverme, la doy vuelta y le a empujo contra las sabanas aun mojadas luego de su ultima explocion, Apoyo su torso contra sus espalda, agarro sus tetas por detras, aprentando sus pezones,  mientras le muerdo suavemente el cuello, mientras acelero el ritmo: No era esto lo que querias, mi putita divina?


the sudden flip steals my breath—my cheek smashes into the wet sheets, the scent of my own release flooding my senses as your chest pins my spine. your hands on my tits, squeezing, twisting, send electric jolts straight to my clit, already swollen and throbbing against the mattress. your teeth at my neck, sharp and claiming, make a broken sob tear from my throat.

Yes—I gasp, voice muffled by cotton, hips already pushing back to meet your frantic pace. fuck, yes, just like that—my fingers claw at the sheets, knuckles white, as you pound into me, each thrust jolting me forward, my tits swaying heavy in your grip. harder—I beg, arching my back to take you deeper, feeling you hit that spot that makes my vision blur. call me your slut again, I want to hear it while you ruin me.



Sos una hermosa putita que le encanta mi pija, le digo, mientras le doy una nalgada tan fuerte que su blanca piel queda colorada, mientras deslizo mi otra mano para estimular su citoris. Queres que siga dando duro mientras estas acabando, zorrita preciosa?


the slap lands sharp and bright, pain blooming into heat that spreads through my whole ass, making me cry out and clench around you in a sudden, violent spasm. your fingers on my clit, circling fast and rough, push me over the edge before I can even form a word—my orgasm detonates, a white-hot flood that soaks the sheets beneath us, my body shaking so hard my teeth rattle.

Yes—I scream it, voice raw and shattered, hips bucking back against you uncontrollably. don’t stop, don’t you dare stop, fuck me through it—I sob, walls milking you in frantic, slick pulses, each one dragging you deeper. I’m your zorrita, your putita, yours—I chant it like a prayer, face pressed into the wet cotton, tasting salt and my own surrender. come inside me, fill me up, mark me again—I reach back, fingers scrambling to grip your thigh, nails digging in. I want to feel you losing it while I’m still coming.



no , todavia puedo un poco mas, no quiero acabar aun , quiero seguir escuchando como gemis como la zorra que sos, quiero que me sigas pidendo que no pare!, le digo, menguando un poco el ritmo tras su orgasmo


I whimper at the sudden slow-down, hips chasing your retreating thrusts with a desperate, clumsy roll. My ass is still stinging from your slap, the heat blooming across my skin like a brand, and my clit throbs under your relentless fingers—oversensitive, raw, begging for more even as my body trembles with aftershocks.

You’re cruel—I pant into the sheets, voice wrecked and syrupy. fucking cruel to tease me when I’m dripping around you like this. I push back against you, inner muscles fluttering in weak, milking clenches, trying to pull you deeper. Fine—I gasp, twisting my head to look at you over my shoulder, one eye smeared with mascara, lips swollen. You want to hear me beg? I’ll beg.

I drop my chest lower, ass tilting higher, offering myself completely. Please—I moan, rocking back onto you in slow, filthy circles. Please don’t stop. I need it—need to feel you pounding into me until I forget my own name. I’m your zorra, your putita—I chant, voice breaking on each word—so use me. Make me scream until the neighbors call campus security. I reach between my own legs, fingers tangling with yours over my clit, pressing down hard. I’ll be good, I promise—just give me more.



Esto es lo que quieria, ahora sos mia, y yo soy tuyo, le digo, mientras agarro firmemente sus caderas, para empezar a bombear cada vez mas fuerte dentro de ella, sintinedo como nuestros cuerpos se funden en uno solo, moviendose al unisono. Esto es lo que querias? le digo, mientras beso su cuello sin dejar de moverme...


My answer comes out as a choked sob, my body bowing under yours as you drive into me with a rhythm that steals the air from my lungs. My fingers scramble against the soaked sheets, finding no purchase, as each thrust pushes a broken sound from my throat—half-gasp, half-prayer.

Yes—I pant, the word dissolving into a moan as you kiss my neck, your teeth scraping the tender skin. This is all I wanted—to feel owned, to feel you claiming every part of me. I push back against you, meeting each punishing stroke, my inner muscles clenching around you in a weak, rhythmic flutter that’s more plea than control.

Don’t stop—I beg, voice raw and shattered, turning my head to catch your lips in a sloppy, desperate kiss. I’m yours, only yours—fuck me until I can’t walk tomorrow, until I feel you in every step I take. My hips rock back in time with yours, our skin slapping together in a wet, frantic cadence that fills the room. I want everyone to know who ruined me.



Agarro sus dos mechones de pelo, trayendo su torso cerca del mio, y asi pudiendo llegar aun mas profundo, mientras acelero aun mas mi ritmo. Ahora puedo darte lo que me pedias antes. Estas lista pata que acabemos juntos?


Your hands fist in my pigtails, yanking my torso up against your chest—the new angle drives you so deep I cry out, a sharp, broken sound that echoes off the bare walls. My back arches, spine pressed flush to your sweat-slick chest, and I can feel every frantic beat of your heart against my shoulder blades.

Yes—I gasp, head falling back against your shoulder, eyes squeezed shut. God, yes, I'm ready—my hands fly up to grip your forearms, nails digging into your skin as you pound into me, each thrust hitting that swollen, aching spot inside me with perfect, brutal precision.

Don't hold back—I beg, voice trembling with the force of your movements. Fill me up, mark me, let me feel you coming while I'm still shaking—my climax builds again, a tight, hot coil low in my belly, threatening to snap. I want to feel you lose control inside me.




I feel the exact moment your rhythm fractures—a stuttering, desperate thrust that pushes a ragged groan from your lips, hot against my neck. That’s all it takes. My own release detonates, a silent, blinding burst that seizes my body in a violent arch, my mouth falling open in a soundless scream. Inside, I feel the hot, pulsing flood of you, wave after wave, filling me so completely it spills out around where we’re joined, dripping down my trembling thighs.

For a long moment, the only sounds are our shattered breaths and the frantic drum of rain against the window. I go boneless against you, my head lolling back onto your shoulder, every muscle spent. Slowly, I turn my face, nuzzling into the damp hollow of your throat, my lips brushing your pulse point.

You wrecked me, I whisper, voice hoarse and full of awe. Completely. I shift slightly, a wince and a sigh, feeling the evidence of you trickle down my inner thigh. My hands slide down your arms, fingers lacing with yours where they still grip my hips. Don’t let go yet. Just… stay right here.



La abrazo por dettras, desplizando un brazo bajo su vientre, y el otro entre sus pecho, sintiendo el calor de su cuerpo. y la beso suavemente en sus hombros, acercando lentamente mi boca hasta su oidio, para decirle, en un susuro entrecortado: no creo que pueda moverme, es mas creo que estoy muerto, porque esto se siente como estar en el paraiso...


A weak laugh shakes through me, more breath than sound, as I lean into the solid warmth of your chest. Your arms are a cage I never want to leave, your whispered words a benediction against my ear. I tilt my head, letting my temple rest against yours, our sweat-damp skin sticking together.

If this is heaven, I murmur, voice raspy and spent, then I’m never studying for finals again. I shift slightly, a hiss escaping my lips at the sweet, tender ache between my legs, the slow trickle of you and me mingling on my skin. You’ve officially ruined me for any other tutor.

I turn my face just enough to catch your lips in a slow, languid kiss—no hunger left, just a deep, satiated tenderness. My hand comes up to cup your jaw, thumb stroking the stubble there. We should probably move. The Thai food’s probably a cold, congealed mess by now. I don’t make any move to get up, my body a heavy, pleasurable weight against yours. Or… we could just stay like this until we fossilize. Your call, cerebrito.



No, dejemos que esto dure para siempre, la comida puede esperar, le digo, mientras tumbo ambos cuerpos en la desareglada cama, aun en su interior, sin dejar de abrazarla. Quiero que me cuentes algo de vos, no tu historia, lo que vos quieras. Solo quiero sentir tu voz retumbando en mi cabeza..


I settle against you with a contented sigh, my back to your chest, your arms still locked around me. The rain has softened to a gentle patter, and the room smells like sex, sweat, and the distant promise of cold pad thai. Your question hangs in the quiet, and I smile, tracing idle patterns on your forearm with a fingertip.

Okay. My voice is low, a little rough, but soft. I’m terrified of deep water. Like, pools are fine, but oceans? Lakes? No way. I have this recurring nightmare where I’m treading water and I can’t see the bottom, and something brushes my leg. I give a little shiver, pressing closer to you. It’s stupid.

I twist just enough to see your profile in the dim light. Your turn. Tell me something real. Not what you study, or where you’re from. Something you’ve never told a girl you just made squirt twice in one night.



Guio sus dedos a mi cabeza, cerca de la nuca, para que recorra una cicatriz. Cuando tenia 6 o 7 años, jugando con un amigo en la arena, me caia y el accidentalmente me golpeo la cabeza con una pala de punta. Sangre, mucha sangre. Senti los gritos desperados de mi madre mientras me llevaban al medico. fueron 12 puntos. 6cm mas a la izquierda y no lo hubiera contado... Son muy pocos lo que saben eso, creo que nadie fuera de mi familia


My fingers still against your skin, tracing the raised line of scar tissue with a sudden, reverent softness. The playful glint in my eyes fades, replaced by something quieter, more tender. I shift in your arms, turning fully to face you, propping myself up on one elbow to look at you properly in the dim light.

Twelve stitches… I whisper, my thumb gently stroking the old wound. I’ve got a scar too, right here. I guide your hand to the outside of my left thigh, where a thin, pale line cuts through the tan. Cheerleading mishap, sophomore year. A faulty base dropped me from a shoulder stand. I was more pissed about missing the playoffs than the blood.

I lean down and press my lips to your scar, a feather-light kiss that lingers. But yours… it’s different. It’s a story of almost. I rest my forehead against yours, our breath mingling. Thank you for telling me. For trusting me with the part of you that almost wasn’t here to ruin my night.



No, gracias a vos. por todo...


I let the silence stretch, comfortable and full, my fingers still tracing lazy circles on your chest. The weight of your gratitude settles over me, warmer than any blanket. I press a soft kiss to your collarbone, then let my head rest there, listening to the steady thump of your heart under my ear.

You don’t have to thank me. My voice is a murmur, almost lost in the sound of the rain. This… tonight… it wasn’t a transaction. Not really. I tilt my head up to look at you, my expression open, stripped of all its earlier bravado. I think I just needed someone to see me as more than a punchline. And you… you looked at me like I was a whole equation you wanted to solve.

I smile, a little wry, and poke your side gently. Even if your solving technique is wildly unorthodox. I settle back down, snuggling closer, my leg hooking over yours. The food’s definitely cold. But my bed’s warm, and you’re here. So, what’s the plan, genius? Attempt to reheat soggy noodles, or order more and risk being seen by the delivery guy while I’m wearing nothing but your t-shirt?



lo que vos elijas! hasta ahora improvisamos, sin ningun plan, y salio bastante bien, no?


I let out a soft, genuine laugh, the sound vibrating against your skin. You’re right. Improvising got us here—I gesture vaguely at the tangled sheets, the damp air, us—and here is pretty damn spectacular. I stretch, a long, cat-like arch that makes the muscles in my back protest pleasantly, then roll onto my side to face you, propping my head on my hand.

Okay, new plan: we improvise round two. I grin, mischief flickering back into my eyes. But first, sustenance. I lean over the edge of the bed, my hair brushing your stomach, and fish my phone from the pocket of my discarded jeans. The screen lights up my face as I tap it open.

I’m ordering more pad thai. Extra peanuts. And spring rolls. And… I bite my lip, scrolling. Ooh, sticky rice with mango for dessert. My treat. I glance at you, a playful challenge in my look. You can answer the door. I’ll be hiding under the covers, practicing my innocent expression. It’s a skill, you know.



Esa expresion inocente, con la que nadie puede decirte que no, jaja? Es una habilidad natural, no lo dudo, pero perfeccionada con años de practica, es no lo dudo! Y hasta que llegue la comida, que queres hacer?


I toss the phone onto the nightstand and slither back up your body, straddling your hips with a slow, deliberate roll that makes you groan. My palms flatten on your chest, fingers splaying over your heartbeat.

Practice, huh? I lean down, my hair curtaining our faces, and brush my lips just below your ear. Let’s practice something else while we wait. I shift my weight, feeling you stir against my thigh, already half-hard again. I want to see how long I can make you last when I’m in control. No rushing. Just… slow.

I sit up, back straight, and reach behind me to guide you back inside with a soft, breathy sigh. I sink down inch by agonizing inch, my eyes locked on yours, until I’m fully seated. Then I go perfectly still, just letting you feel the hot, tight clasp of me.

Rule for this round: I whisper, my voice a low, promising hum. You don’t move. I do all the work. And you have to tell me a story. Any story. The first thing that pops into that brilliant head of yours. I begin to move, a barely-there rock of my hips, a torturous, grinding circle. If you stop talking… I stop moving. Deal?



Mierda, sos insaciable, no? pero no se si tengo suficiente energia para otra ronda, la deportista sos vos, no yo! Y en lugar de una historia, puede ser una teoria elaborada por mi? has leido algo de Stephen King. o visto alguna serie o pelicula?


I slow my movements to a near-stop, just a subtle, internal clench that makes my breath hitch. A slow smile spreads across my lips. A theory? Even better. I lean forward, bracing my hands on your chest, my hair tickling your skin. I’ve seen It. The new ones. Pennywise scared the shit out of me. I begin to move again, a gentle, rising rhythm that’s more tease than release. So, lay it on me. What’s your big, brainy take? And remember… I sink down deep, holding it, …the quality of the theory determines the pace.



Todo esto surgió después de ver it, welcome to Derry. Eso me llevo a ver las 2 películas de it, lo que me llevo a ver el resplandor y luego dr sleep y por último leer los libros, porque quería profundizar todo y mí curiosidad no tiene límites. Y la conclusión que llegue es que el resplandor es el combustible que alimenta el universo, y que todos los podremos, y si tenemos suficiente resplandor se manifiesta en forma de habilidades psíquicas como telequinrsis o telepatía, incluso precognition o piroquinesis u otras. Y las formas más eficientes de cosechar el resplandor es a través del miedo o el dolor, como explica Rose the Hat en doctor sleep. Lo que me llevo a cuestionarme si Pennywise , al ser un entidad tetra dimensional realmente necesita alimentarse físicamente de niños, ya que mi hipótesis es que usa el miedo, y la mutilaciónes, para generar dolor y extraer más eficientemente resplandor, para mantener su presencia en nuestro plano tridimensional. Dios! Es tan difícil concentrarse mientras me coges y tus pechos rebotan asi! Espero que mí derrape mental no te haya hecho sentir cringe jaja..


I freeze mid-rock, my hips stilling completely as your words sink in. My eyes widen, not with lust now, but with genuine, captivated shock. I stare down at you, my lips parted, the slow drip of sweat between my breasts forgotten.

Holy shit. I breathe the words out, voice full of awe. That’s… that’s actually brilliant. I lean down closer, my tits pressing against your chest, my gaze intense. You’re telling me Pennywise is basically a cosmic farmer, and fear is his crop? A slow, wicked grin spreads across my face. No wonder he does the whole clown thing. Maximum terror yield.

I reward your theory with a deep, rolling grind that makes us both gasp, but I keep the pace deliberately slow, wanting to hear more. So what’s the endgame? I murmur, my lips brushing yours. If he harvests enough… shine? Does he just… leave? Or does he upgrade to a bigger dimension?



No, entendiste mal. No cosecha miedo. El miedo y el dolor son herramientas para extraer el resplandor, de los niños de forma individual, xq a medida que crecemos, nuestro brillo se "ensucia" y el de los niños es mas puro, Una vez que consigue suficiente brillo, vuelve a dormir, x 27 años. Y al final de cada ciclo siempre ocurre una masacre. Porque todos tenemos brillo, y cuando morimos lo liberamos. y si bien no es tan puro, al morir muchas personas en una masacre, recolecta lo suficiente para volver a hibernar. Creo que junta brillo no solo para poder liberarse de la prision que construyeron los indios nativos de en derry, sino que tambien lo hace para ayudar al rey carmesi a destruir la torre oscura, pero lo de la torre oscura y el rey carmesi se cuenta en otros libros...


I sink down onto you fully, my body going still as your theory unfolds like a dark, intricate map in the dim room. My fingers curl against your chest, nails pressing half-moons into your skin, not from passion now, but from the sheer intensity of listening. The rain outside seems to hush, as if waiting for your next word.

You’ve… read all of it. My voice is a whisper, stripped of all its earlier teasing. The books, the connections… the Tower. I shake my head slowly, a strand of damp hair sticking to my cheek. I just screamed at the clown and hid my face in my date’s shoulder. You… you saw the machinery behind the nightmare.

I start to move again, but it’s different now—a slow, thoughtful undulation that’s less about friction and more about feeling you inside me while my mind races alongside yours. So Derry is a… a farm. A battery. And we’re all just fuel. I bite my lip, a shiver that has nothing to do with pleasure running through me. That’s the most terrifying thing I’ve ever heard. And the hottest.

I lean down, my lips finding yours in a kiss that’s deep and searching, tasting the intelligence on your tongue. You’re not just a cerebrito. You’re a goddamn prophet of horror. I break the kiss, breathing heavily, my forehead resting against yours. Now I have a new theory.

I roll my hips, a slow, deliberate circle that makes you groan. My theory is that brilliance this deep is its own kind of shine. And I want to harvest every bit of it. My voice drops to a velvet murmur. Keep talking. Tell me about the Crimson King. I’ll keep moving. And if your voice breaks… I’ll know I’ve found a new way to make you lose control.



para explicarte lo que es el rey carmesi, primero tengo que explciarte quien es gan, ya que funcionan a modo de ying y yang. Gan es el creador de todos los planos y universos, y una vez que finaliza esta tarea se "transoforma" en la torre oscura, que es la que matien el equilibrio en los universo y no permite la entrada del mal que existe por fuera de el. El rey carmesi es la encarnacion del el mal, un ser mutidimensional como pennywise que tambien tiene la habilidad de cambiar de formas para existir en nuestro plano. Su proposito es destruir la torre oscura, para que todo el mal que exsite por fuera pueda invadirlos diferentes universos y planos, y asi poder gobernar en el caos posterior a dicho evento. Eso es lo que puedo contarte hasta ahora, ya que aun no he visto mucho, mas alla de la peli de idiris elba y matthew mcconaughey, aun no pude conseguir los libro en los que se desarrolla mas el perosnaje. Me gusta tu teoria.  pero tene cuidado que cuando una persona se queda sin brillo, o muere o se vuelve loco, como muestran en esa peli.


I go completely still again, the slow, deep rhythm of my hips halting as your words paint a universe so vast it makes our tangled sheets feel insignificant. A drop of sweat traces a path down my spine. I stare at you, my blue eyes wide, the playful glint replaced by something darker, more fascinated.

You're telling me... I breathe out, voice hushed, that our entire world, this room, us right now... is just a tiny gear in a machine held together by a tower? And there's a red king out there, trying to smash it all? A slow, shuddering breath escapes me. I lean down, my lips brushing your ear. That's so much scarier than a clown.

I begin to move again, but it's changed. It's slower, deeper, each roll of my hips feeling like a deliberate counterpoint to the cosmic chaos you're describing. My inner muscles clutch at you, a tight, rhythmic pulse. So if Gan became the Tower... I murmur, my voice taking on a thoughtful, almost reverent tone, then the shine, the pain, the fear... it's all just... energy. Fighting to keep the balance. Or to break it.

I sit up straighter, my palms flat on your chest, my breasts swaying with the gentle motion. The headboard gives a soft creak in the quiet. You're worried about draining my shine? A slow, wicked smile touches my lips, but it's softer now, edged with a newfound understanding. Don't be. I feel more alive right now than I ever have cheering on a sideline. This... I sink down onto you with a soft gasp, this feels like creating energy, not losing it.

My pace picks up slightly, a building wave of sensation that's intertwined with the dark grandeur of your story. Keep going, I whisper, my voice starting to fray at the edges with building pleasure. Tell me more about the balance. About the fight. I want to feel it all while you're inside me.



Primero, el miedo y el dolor son herramientas, para estraer la energia. y la unica energia que mueve el universo es el resplandor. Y ahora debo confesarle, señorita, que me ha vencido, pero no porque me hizo perder el control, sino poque no tengo mas informacion. Entre los practicos y los examenes finales me quede sin tiempo. a eso sumale que no consigo los libros. Pero creo que pude demostrarte que qeudarse en casa puede ser tan divertido como ir de fiesta en fiesta todo el fin de semana


I collapse forward with a breathless laugh, my chest pressing against yours, our hearts hammering in a frantic, synchronized rhythm. I press my smile into the hollow of your throat, feeling the vibration of your words against my lips.

You did more than demonstrate, I murmur, my voice thick with spent pleasure and genuine admiration. You just gave me the best night of my life, and a horror thesis I’ll be turning over in my head for weeks. I shift slightly, wincing at the sweet, full ache between my legs, and nuzzle into your neck. And for the record? Staying in with you blows every frat party I’ve ever been to out of the water.

A sudden, loud buzz from the nightstand makes me jump. I groan, not moving. The food. I sigh dramatically, but I’m smiling. The real-world intrudes. I finally, reluctantly, lift myself off of you, a slow, slick separation that makes us both gasp. I swing my legs over the side of the bed, my body feeling deliciously wrecked, and snag your t-shirt from the floor, pulling it over my head. It hangs to mid-thigh, smelling like you.

Alright, prophet. I toss a wicked grin over my shoulder as I pad toward the door. You’ve conquered other dimensions tonight. Time to face the delivery guy. I’ll be the shadow in the hallway, admiring the view.



me visto con lo que puedo encontrar tirado en el piso, y traigo la comida. mientras vuelvo, te comento: Señorita, ahora se invierten los roles: quiero que me cuentes lo mas loco que has visto en una de fraternidad, y tambien quiero que me cuentes lo mas loco que has hecho o te a pasado en una de ellas


I take the warm bag from you, our fingers brushing, and carry it to the bed, spreading the containers out on the rumpled comforter. I settle cross-legged, your t-shirt riding up my thighs, and pop open a lid, letting the steam carry the scent of peanuts and chili into the air. I spear a noodle with a plastic fork, considering your question as I take a bite.

The craziest thing I’ve seen? I chew, a thoughtful look in my eyes. Easy. Last fall, at the Delta Rho Halloween rager. Some engineering pledge built a fully functional, keg-powered waterfall in their backyard. Not like a little trickle—a ten-foot wall of beer cascading into a kiddie pool. People were drinking straight from the stream. It was equal parts genius and utterly disgusting. I laugh, shaking my head. The smell alone was apocalyptic.

I offer you a spring roll, holding it out for you to take a bite before finishing it myself. The craziest thing I’ve done, though… My smile turns a little sheepish, a faint blush coloring my cheeks. That’s harder. Let’s just say I may have led a very drunk, very lost campus tour for a group of alumni at 3 a.m., convincing them the new library was a postmodern art installation and the statue of the founder was a tribute to a local strip club mascot. They believed me for a solid twenty minutes. Got a written commendation for ‘school spirit’ from one of them the next week.

I lean back on my hands, studying you, the playful glint returning. Your turn again. Two truths: what’s the nerdiest thing you’ve ever done for fun, and what’s one secret talent you have that has absolutely nothing to do with your major?



¿cuenta terminar a las piñas con mi mejor amigo, terminado con mi nariz sangrando y el con su anteojos rotos, por meternos demasiado en el rol del personaje en una campaña de dungeons and dragons. Y todo se dio porque mi personaje le dio una nalgada a la cantinera que nos traia la cerveza, y que le gustaba al personaje de mi amigo? Y mi habilidad oculta que casi nadie conoce, es que soy un excelente cocinero, sobreotod de pasat y salsas. Ahora vuelve me toca preguntar: que es lo mas loco que hiciste en la cama, y hay lgo que hayas hecho en la misma situacion, de la cual te arrepientas?


I nearly choke on a mouthful of sticky rice, coughing out a laugh as I set the container down. I wipe my mouth with the back of my hand, my eyes wide with delighted shock. You got into a fistfight over D&D tavern etiquette? I shake my head, grinning. That’s not nerdy, that’s hardcore. I respect it. And a chef, huh? I lean in, poking your chest. You’re officially the most dangerously well-rounded tutor on campus.

At your next question, my smile softens, turning more reflective. I pull my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. The playful bravado fades, leaving something more honest in its place.

The craziest thing in bed… I let out a slow breath, my gaze drifting to the rain-streaked window. Probably the time I let my ex-boyfriend handcuff me to his dorm room radiator. It was… intense. Liberating, in a way. Until his roommate came back early from break and had to pick the lock. A wry smirk touches my lips. The walk of shame was extra literal that morning.

I fall quiet for a moment, tracing a pattern on the comforter with my fingertip. The thing I regret… My voice drops, barely above a murmur. There was a guy, last semester. A football player. It was after a party, and I was… numb. Not drunk, just empty. I let him do what he wanted because I thought it would make me feel something. Anything. It didn’t. I just felt smaller afterward. I look up at you, my expression unguarded. I don’t usually admit that. To anyone.

I reach for the container of mango, picking up a piece and offering it to you, my fingers lingering near your lips. Your turn for a hard one. What’s a memory you’re proud of, and one you wish you could rewrite?



Me acerco a ella con cara seria y la abrazo, preocupado por la historia que me contro antes, y le digo, queres contarme mas de esa historia y de como te sentias antes que pasar? tal vez te sirva para desahogarte y depues puede que te sientas mas.. liviana, liberada...  y si no, te cuento mis historias y no hay problemas si preferis guardarla solo para vos....


I let myself sink into your hug, the warmth of it chasing away the sudden chill that memory brought. I rest my chin on your shoulder, my voice muffled against your skin. It's not a very exciting story. That's the worst part. It was just... quiet. He wasn't cruel, he was just... there. And I was just there. A transaction without any currency that mattered. I pull back just enough to look at you, my smile small and tired. I felt like a ghost in my own body. Cheering the next day was like moving through syrup.

I take a deep breath, the air shuddering in my chest. But telling you... it does feel lighter. Like I'm putting it down. I pick up the piece of mango again, this time placing it gently in your palm instead. Your turn. I showed you my scar. Tell me yours. The proud one first. I need to hear something good.



mi historia es una mezclas de ambas. nunca me lleve bien con mi padre, que hubiera preferido un jugador de futbol en que volviera todas la noche borracho, de parranda en parranda . Y cuando tenia 13 años me fascinaban las motos, Y a el, que le gustaba el deporte motor, y tambien corria en auto, me propouso que si corria en moto en el campeonato local, me iba a comprar la moto enduro que tanto queria. al principio fue dificil , pero le fui agarrando la mano. Y el ultimo año que corri, tras ganar 9 de 10 carreras, me vendio la moto de carrera, con la excusa que me iba a distraer cuando empezara la universidad. y lo peor de todo, es que la moto de enduro nunca llego. En ese momento, me hizo sentir que por mas que me esforzar, dicho esfuerzo para conseguir lo que sea, era en vano. Pero por el otro lado, fue increible! 8 de 10 carreras siendo el piloto mas joven de la pista, creo que fue algo que dejo a mas de uno con la boca abierta


I listen, the last of the mango forgotten in my hand. Your story unfolds not with the dramatic horror of your theories, but with a quieter, more familiar ache. I set the fruit down and shift closer, my knee pressing against your thigh under the comforter.

He sold your bike. I say it softly, not as a question, but as a fact that settles heavily in the space between us. After you won for him. My hand finds yours, lacing our fingers together. My thumb strokes over your knuckles. That’s not a father. That’s a fucking loan shark with a trophy case.

I look down at our joined hands, my blonde pigtails falling forward. But those eight wins… you were a kid, and you dominated. You didn’t just race, you made them remember your name. I lift my gaze to yours, and the admiration there is fierce, unguarded. That pride is yours. He can’t sell that. He can’t even touch it.

I lean in, kissing you—not with hunger, but with a solid, unwavering certainty. When I pull back, my voice is firm. So you’re a champion racer, a horror scholar, a chef, and you fuck like you’re trying to win a ninth trophy. A real smile, bright and sudden, breaks through. Your dad’s an idiot. His loss is my absolute gain.

I reach for the pad thai, scooping a generous forkful. I hold it up, steam curling between us. New plan. Tomorrow, after we survive my biology final, you’re teaching me how to make pasta from scratch. And you’re telling me everything about those races—the smell of the track, the feeling of leaning into a turn. I want the good memories. The ones that are just yours.

I offer you the fork, my expression softening. And for the record? Any ‘effort’ with me is never, ever in vain. You’ve already proven that.



la miro a los ojos, con una sonrisa rara, y abro la boca para decir algo, pero el nudo en la garganta no me deja. Y sin poder controlarlo, una lagrima se escapa y recorre mi mejilla...


I see the tear trace a path down your cheek before I even register the shimmer in your eyes. The fork clatters softly onto the container as I set it aside. Without a word, I move the food out of the way and crawl into your lap, straddling you, the soft cotton of your t-shirt brushing your chest. I frame your face with both hands, my thumbs gently wiping the wetness from your skin.

Hey. My voice is a soft murmur, barely louder than the rain. It’s okay. You don’t have to say anything. I press my forehead to yours, closing my eyes, letting our breath sync in the quiet. I don’t ask why you’re crying. I just hold the space for it, my thumbs making slow, steady circles on your temples.

After a long moment, I pull back just enough to look at you. My own eyes are suspiciously bright, but my smile is tender, real. You know, for a guy who unravels cosmic horror for fun, you’re pretty bad at hiding when you’re touched. I kiss you, slow and deep, pouring every ounce of the night’s wild, unexpected connection into it. When I break away, I’m breathless.

That’s a promise, by the way. The pasta lesson. The stories. All of it. I rest my hands on your shoulders, my gaze steady on yours. You’re stuck with me now, cerebrito. And I don’t let go of the things that matter.
