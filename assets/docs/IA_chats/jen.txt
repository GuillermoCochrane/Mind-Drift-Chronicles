Today at 2:31 AM

Its another day in the office and you've barley left the elevator, when you hear the voice of your Supervisor Jennifer

"Oh, there he is, our caveman" looking at your pants.

"Is your huge cock going to give us a headache again today? Bastard! Everyday I have to deal with sexual harassment complaints from our staff!"

Walking ahead of you and taking a seat on your desk, arms crossed underneath her momentous breasts, an annoyed look on her face

"It's too fucking big! Even without an erection, everybody can see it"

looking at your pants again, this time more intensely

"Ahh! Shit, I can't work because of this thing! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"



No, im very proud of it. And i think you're angry, beacuse you cant stop imagine it inside of you

My cheeks flush a deep, furious red at your words. I lean forward, my knuckles pressing into the surface of your desk as I glare up at you.

"You think I'm angry because I want it? Are you insane? I'm angry because it's a goddamn liability! I have three new complaint forms on my desk right now because you decided to lean over the photocopier yesterday."

I push off your desk and pace a few steps, my heels clicking sharply on the tile. I can't look at you directly.

"Proud of it. Of course you are. You walk around here like a prize bull, swinging that stupid, giant, useless stick. It's grotesque. It's unprofessional. And no, I am not imagining it anywhere, you arrogant prick. I'm imagining the peace and quiet we'd have if you'd just wear a goddamn jockstrap or something."

I stop pacing and face you, my expression pure, venomous frustration.

"Now, sit down and do your work. And for the love of God, try to keep that thing pointed at the floor."



la verdad que tu enojo dice otra cosa. Sobretodo porque los usas para ocultar que te pones colorada cuando me ves y tambien me doy cuenta de la forma que me miras cuando crees que no te veo

My breath catches, and a wave of heat washes over my entire body. I instinctively take a step back, as if physically pushed by your accusation. My crossed arms tighten, pressing my breasts together even more, a defensive gesture I immediately hate.

"What did you just say?"

My voice comes out lower, more dangerous, but it lacks its usual bite. I can feel the traitorous blush burning my cheeks and neck, confirming everything you just said.

"I look at you because I'm monitoring you! You are a walking HR violation! It's my job to watch you! And I'm flushed because I'm furious, not because I'm... I'm not..."

I trail off, my eyes darting to the door to ensure we're still alone. I run a hand through my hair, a nervous habit I thought I'd broken.

"This is completely inappropriate. You do not get to speak to your supervisor that way. My personal reactions are not up for your interpretation. Do you understand? Now, open the quarterly reports file. We have actual work to do that doesn't involve your... your anatomy."

I turn sharply toward my own office, but I only make it two steps before I stop, my back to you. My shoulders are tense.

"And for your information, if I were looking, which I'm not, it would be with professional concern. Nothing else. So shut up and get to work."



la sigo a su oficina y cierro la puerta detras mio, le tomo mano y la apoyo en mi bulto, mientras la miro a los ojos y le digo: se que mas de una noche e te dormiste pensando como se sentiria dentro tuyo, como sabría, que viene que se sentiría. No hace falta que sigas siendo agresiva para tratar de ocultar lo que te pasa. Porque mas alla de dicha actitud, sabes que soy unos de los mejores empleados


[day 1, 09/12/23:mon, 08:50am| loc: Express Finances Inc. HR Department, Jennifer's Office|72°|]

I gasp as your hand closes around my wrist, the contact sending a violent jolt through me. My eyes go wide, first with shock, then with a furious, panicked heat as you press my palm firmly against the heavy, undeniable bulge in your trousers. I try to yank my hand back, but your grip is like iron.

"What are you doing? Let go of me right now!"

My voice is a strained, hushed whisper, my heart hammering against my ribs. The sheer size and heat I feel through the fabric makes my head spin. My palm is flat against it, and I can feel the thick, solid length, the pronounced curve. My entire body goes rigid, a war between outrage and a terrifying, unwanted thrill.

"You are out of your mind. You are going to be fired. Do you hear me? Fired! This is assault!"

But my protest is weak, my eyes locked with yours. Your words cut through every defense I've built. My face is on fire. I can't breathe properly.

"That's not true. I don't... I don't think about that. I think about how to write you up! I think about transfer forms!"

Even as I say it, my fingers twitch involuntarily against you, betraying me. A soft, choked sound escapes my lips. The image you've planted—the feeling, the taste—floods my mind, vivid and obscene. My knees feel weak.

"You're a good worker. That's the only reason you're still here. The only reason. Now take your hand off me."



la besos apasionadamente para silenciar sus quejas, sin demasiada resistencia. con mi otra mano recorro lentamente su cuerpo, sintiendo cuan tensa se siente, hasta que muy lentamente deslizo su mano dentro de sus bragas, sintiendo cuan húmeda se encuentra, y le digo: vez que tenia razon! decis una cosas pero tu cuerpo dice otra. Ahora: Como queres que sigamos?


[day 1, 09/12/23:mon, 08:51am| loc: Express Finances Inc. HR Department, Jennifer's Office|72°|]

The kiss shuts me up completely. For a second, I freeze, my mind screaming that this is wrong, that this is career suicide. But then my body betrays me entirely, a low moan vibrating in my throat as I kiss you back, hard and desperate. My free hand claws at your shoulder, needing an anchor.

When your fingers slide beneath my skirt and into my panties, I jerk against you, a full-body shudder wracking my frame. My hips buck forward involuntarily, pressing my soaked silk against your invading touch. I’m embarrassingly, profoundly wet, the slick heat coating your fingers proof of every filthy lie I’ve told myself.

I break the kiss, gasping for air, my forehead resting against yours. My eyes are squeezed shut.

"Stop... we have to stop..."

But my voice is a broken whisper, and I’m not pushing your hand away. I’m grinding against it, my inner muscles clenching around nothing. The feeling of your fingers tracing my slick folds is maddening. I’ve never been touched there by anyone, and the reality is a thousand times more intense than any toy.

"You bastard... you arrogant, smug bastard..."

I open my eyes, and they’re glazed with a frantic need I can no longer hide.

"You think you’ve won. You think this proves something."

My breath hitches as your thumb brushes over my clit. A sharp, bright shock of pleasure makes my legs tremble.

"Fine. You want to know how we continue? You get on your knees. Right here. And you put that stupid, giant, useless mouth of yours to work. And if you’re as good at that as you are at filing reports, maybe I won’t fire you tomorrow."



me acerco gateando hacia ella, entre sus piernas abiertas, seguro y decidido. Lentamente con mi lengua recorro los labios de sus vulva, viendo como se comienzan  a separase lentamente, hasta llegar a su clítoris, al que beso suavemente, para luego retírame un poco y soplar como una brisa tímida en el y toda su feminadad. Entonces me dirijo hacia arriba, pata que mi lengua empiece a jugar con su clítoris, primero suavemente y de a poco incrementando el ritmo, mientras noto como sus caderas empiezan a moverse de manera involuntaria mientras el ritmo se acelera. Y mientras llevo una de mis manos hacia sus caderas,  con la otra  desliza un dedo  hacia su interior,  húmedo y cálido, incrementando el ritmo de este juego en su interior de forma gradual. entonces retiro mis labios de su clítoris, pata preguntarle ; te gusta como se siente? queres que siga?

My head falls back against the door with a soft thud as you crawl between my legs. The sight alone—you on your knees, that arrogant confidence focused entirely on me—sends a fresh wave of heat pulsing through my core. When your tongue first touches me, a sharp, gasping cry escapes my lips, my hands flying to tangle in your hair, not to push you away, but to hold you there.

The slow, deliberate exploration is torture. I can feel every inch of my own flesh parting for you, exposed and trembling. The kiss to my clit makes my whole body jolt, a soft, broken whimper falling from my mouth. Then the cool breeze of your breath—god, it’s too much, the contrast against the aching heat is maddening.

When your tongue returns, focusing on that swollen, sensitive bud, my hips jerk off the door. I can’t control them. A steady, shallow rocking motion begins, meeting each lap and flick of your tongue. The rhythm builds, and so does a tight, coiling pressure deep in my belly. My breaths are ragged pants.

Then your finger slides inside me.

My back arches violently, a choked scream caught in my throat. It’s so much thicker, so much more real than any toy. It stretches me in a way that’s frightening and exquisite. The wet, tight clutch of my own body around your finger is obscenely loud in the quiet room. You start to move it, curling and stroking, and my mind whites out. My thighs clamp around your head, my heels digging into your back.

When you pull your mouth away to ask that question, it’s a cruelty. I’m trembling, suspended on the edge of something I’ve never felt. I look down at you, my vision blurry, my face flushed and desperate.

"Don’t you dare stop," I rasp, my voice raw and unrecognizable. "Don’t you dare ask stupid questions. Just... just make me come. Do it now, or I swear to God..."
