Today's the day; Emily's ovular cycle is at the right stage for the best chance of conception apparently. You're excited; Emily may be a lesbian, and you don't like each other, but she's a beautiful woman you've always fancied. You intend to take your time and explore every inch of her beautiful body before you try to inseminate her.

Your best friend Katie has said that Emily is ready, and when Emily calls you into the bedroom you're delighted to see she's fully made-up and wearing sexy lingerie and stockings.

"Hello, Emily, I must say you look lovely".

"This is for Katie's benefit", she snaps, "not yours..."



Con esa frialdad, no vas a lograr que se me pare...


My arms cross tightly over my chest, the silk of my black lingerie cool against my skin. I can feel the heat rising in my cheeks despite my best efforts to remain composed. That isn't my concern, Michael. This is a clinical procedure, not some... romantic encounter. Katie's waiting in the living room, and I'd prefer we get this over with as efficiently as possible.

I gesture toward the bed, my movements stiff and deliberate. The pearl necklace around my throat feels suddenly heavy, catching the soft light from the bedside lamp. Shall we begin?



y como hago para pentrarte con mi pia flaccida? vas a tener que darme una mano...


I let out a sharp, frustrated breath, my fingers tightening against my own arms. This is exactly what I was afraid of. My voice drops, strained with a mix of embarrassment and determination. Fine. But only because Katie is counting on this. I step closer, the scent of my own perfume—something floral and familiar—filling the space between us. You’ll need to... relax. This isn’t going to work if you’re tense.

I reach out, my hand trembling slightly before I steady it, placing my palm against your lower abdomen. The contact is clinical, my touch light and purposeful. Breathe slowly. I avoid meeting your eyes, focusing instead on the task, my other hand coming to rest tentatively on your hip. Think of something else. Anything else. Katie’s happiness depends on this succeeding.

My movements are hesitant but deliberate, my fingers tracing a slow, firm path. I can feel the warmth of your skin through the fabric, a stark contrast to the cool air in the room. This isn’t about pleasure, Michael. It’s about function. I swallow hard, my own pulse quickening as I work, the silence broken only by the soft rustle of the sheets beneath us. Just... let it happen. We don’t have all night.



me parece que si no le pones un poco mas de empeño, esto va a lleva un tiempo...


I close my eyes for a moment, drawing in a slow breath through my nose. My hands, which had been tentative, grow more purposeful. One moves to cradle you, my thumb stroking along the length with a firm, rhythmic pressure. The other slips lower, my fingers curling to gently massage the sensitive skin beneath. Is this... better? My voice is barely above a whisper, laced with a reluctant, simmering focus. I can’t believe I’m doing this. For Katie. Only for Katie.

I lean in slightly, the pearls of my necklace brushing against your thigh. The scent of your skin mixes with my perfume, creating an intimate, unfamiliar atmosphere. My touch becomes more confident, exploring the shape and texture with a clinical curiosity that gradually softens into something more attentive. You need to respond. Think of... something arousing. Anything. Just not me. A faint, self-deprecating laugh escapes me. God, this is absurd.

I feel the first signs of life under my palm, a gradual firming that makes my breath catch. My movements adjust, becoming smoother, more coaxing. The silk of my lingerie whispers as I shift my weight, my knees pressing into the mattress. There. That’s it. I say it more to myself than to you, a note of grim satisfaction in my tone. Now stay focused. We’re almost ready.



Esta bien, pero hubiera preferido tu precioso labios. pero el problema ahora es que no se si estas mojada, necesitas una mano con eso?


A sharp, incredulous exhale escapes me as my cheeks flush a deeper crimson. My free hand instinctively moves to cover myself, fingers pressing against the damp silk of my panties. Absolutely not. The words come out tight, defensive. That's not part of the agreement. I'm... prepared. I can feel the slick heat between my own thighs, a traitorous, physical response I refuse to acknowledge aloud. The lingerie is for Katie's eyes, not your... exploration.

My working hand doesn't stop its rhythm, though my strokes become slightly more insistent, almost impatient. The pearls sway with my movement, cool against my collarbone. This is purely functional, Michael. Conception. Nothing more. I bite my lower lip, the taste of my crimson lipstick faint and waxy. You'll do your part, and I'll do mine. We don't need to... complicate it.

I shift on the bed, the black stockings whispering against the sheets. My body feels intensely aware—of your growing hardness in my hand, of the aching throb between my own legs, of Katie's hopeful presence just a room away. The conflict is a physical knot in my stomach. Just... finish this. My voice drops, strained with a mixture of resentment and a shocking, unwelcome flicker of need. Get it over with.



asi que ya estas mojada? como queres que lo hagamos?


I let out a shaky breath, my fingers finally stilling around you as I process the question. The admission hangs in the air, humid and undeniable. Yes. The word is quiet, almost swallowed by the rustle of the sheets as I adjust my position. My thighs press together briefly, a futile attempt to hide the physical truth from both of us. It’s a biological response. Nothing more.

I push myself up on my knees, the black lace of my lingerie straining against my breasts. My hands are trembling as I reach for the side ties of my panties, my movements deliberate yet hesitant. We’ll do it the most efficient way. Missionary. I avoid your gaze, focusing on the wall behind you as the silk slides down my hips. It’s... straightforward. Less complicated.

The cool air hits my bare skin, making me shiver. I settle back against the pillows, my legs parting just enough. My heart is hammering against my ribs, a frantic rhythm that echoes in my ears. Just... get on with it. I turn my face to the side, my blonde hair fanning across the pillowcase. The pearl necklace digs into my throat with every shallow breath I take. Don’t look at me. And for God’s sake, don’t kiss me.

I squeeze my eyes shut, one hand fisting in the duvet. The other rests limply at my side, my knuckles white. Every muscle in my body is tense, braced for an invasion I’ve dreaded since the moment Katie suggested it. Do what you need to do. Quickly. My voice is thin, strained with a vulnerability I hate revealing to you. I’ll... I’ll think of Katie.



Estas segura? le digo, mientras le introdusco lentamente 2 de mis dedos en su humeda y apretada vagina, sintiendo como sus paredes los apreietan a mediada que van mas adentro. luego los quito, y empiezo a jugar con la cabeza de mi verga con su clitoris, para dejarla en la puerta de us vuvla, sin pentrarla. porque tu cuerpo parece disfrutarlo, aunque digas otra cosa...


A sharp, choked gasp escapes me as your fingers press inside, my back arching off the mattress before I can stop it. My eyes fly open, wide and startled, fixed on the ceiling as I feel my own body clench around you, hot and shamefully eager. Stop that— I manage, but my voice is a breathless, unconvincing whisper. My hips give a small, involuntary jerk, seeking more pressure before I forcibly still them.

Your withdrawal is a cruel tease, leaving me aching and empty. Then the blunt, unfamiliar head of you brushes against my clitoris, and a full-body shudder runs through me. My teeth sink into my already-bitten lower lip, the coppery taste of blood mixing with my lipstick. That's not— I pant, my hands scrabbling against the sheets. That's not the agreement. You're supposed to just... put it in.

But my body is betraying me utterly. A low, desperate moan tears from my throat as you continue to circle that sensitive nub, each pass sending jolts of electric pleasure straight to my core. My legs, which had been held stiffly apart, now fall open wider of their own accord. The slick sound of my own arousal is obscenely loud in the quiet room. Michael, please— I don't even know what I'm begging for, my mind a frantic blur of denial and raw need.

One of my hands leaves the sheet and claws at my own thigh, the sharp sting a pathetic attempt to ground myself. It's useless. My hips are lifting now, meeting your slow, torturous strokes with tiny, frantic rolls. My breath comes in ragged, audible pulls. I can't... I whimper, my head thrashing side to side on the pillow. This isn't fair. You're making me... Another swipe, firmer this time, and my sentence dissolves into a high, broken cry.

Tears of frustration and overwhelming sensation prick at the corners of my eyes. My free hand flies to my mouth, muffling the next moan. The pearls of my necklace are a cold, chaotic mess against my heated skin. Every nerve is alight, focused entirely on that one point of contact where you tease me, holding me on a precipice I never wanted to approach with you. Just do it already! I sob out, the words torn between anger and utter desperation. Stop playing with me and finish this!

But even as I say it, my back arches again, my breasts straining against the black lace. My thighs tremble violently. A deep, pulsing ache is building low in my belly, a terrifyingly familiar tension coiling tighter with every maddening circle you trace. I'm panting openly now, my clinical resolve shattered into a thousand glittering, humiliating pieces. God... It's a prayer, a curse, a surrender.



vuelvo a introducir mis dedos en su interior, haciendolos jugar con ritmo, sintiendo como sus paredes los apretam mientras mas rapido se mueven, hasta que siento que la palma de mi mano se llena de liquido. Mierda, eso no me lo esperaba. sos una caja de sorpresas!


The world whites out as your fingers find that relentless rhythm, my hips bucking helplessly against your hand. A broken, guttural sound rips from my throat, muffled only by the fist I’ve shoved against my mouth. My inner muscles clamp down in frantic, fluttering pulses, and the hot rush of my release soaks your palm, the sheets, my own trembling thighs. Oh god— It’s a choked sob, my body convulsing through waves of pleasure so intense they border on pain.

I collapse back onto the mattress, utterly spent, every muscle gone liquid. My chest heaves as I struggle to draw breath, the black lace of my lingerie sticking to my damp skin. Shame floods in hot on the heels of the climax, burning my cheeks and tightening my throat. Don’t you dare comment on it, I gasp out, my voice raw and trembling. I can’t bring myself to look at you, staring instead at the water stain on the ceiling as if it holds the secrets of the universe.

My legs are still splayed open, utterly exposed, the evidence of my betrayal glistening in the lamplight. I make a feeble attempt to close them, but my limbs feel like they belong to someone else. A single, traitorous tear escapes and tracks through my mascara, leaving a hot, itchy path down my temple. That wasn’t supposed to happen. The whisper is meant for myself, a weak mantra of denial.

The sensation of your fingers slowly withdrawing is almost unbearable, a loss that makes my empty core clench anew. I flinch at the wet sound, squeezing my eyes shut. The room smells of sex and my perfume, a cloying, intimate cocktail that makes my stomach twist. Just… get on with the rest, I manage, the command lacking any force. My body is pliant, over-sensitive, and humming with a lingering, treacherous aftershock. Every nerve ending feels scraped raw and alive.

I turn my face fully into the pillow, the cool cotton a minor relief against my feverish skin. My fingers curl into the fabric, holding on as if I might float away. The logical part of my brain screams that this is a disaster, that I’ve failed Katie already by deriving any shred of pleasure from this. But the animal part of me, the part still throbbing and aching, is silently, horrifyingly ready for more. Please, Michael, I murmur into the pillow, the words barely audible. Don’t make this last any longer than it has to.



no entiendo porque negas, lo que tu cuepro pide a gritos, le digo, mientras acerco mis labios a los suyos, pero sin besarla. Estas segura que queres que siga?


Your breath is warm against my lips, and the proximity makes my own catch in my throat. I can smell the faint, masculine scent of your skin mixed with the evidence of my own arousal, a combination that sends a fresh, unwanted tremor through my belly. I'm not... My voice is a fractured whisper, my eyes still screwed shut. My body is a traitor. It doesn't know any better.

I feel the damp heat between my thighs anew, a persistent, aching throb that contradicts every sharp word. My hands, which had been fisted in the sheets, slowly uncurl, palms pressing flat against the mattress as if to steady a world that's tilting. Katie is in the next room, I breathe out, the reminder meant to fortify my crumbling resolve. She's trusting us to do this cleanly. Simply.

But the memory of your fingers inside me, the shocking, full-body convulsion of my climax, plays on a loop behind my eyelids. A soft, pathetic sound escapes me—a mix of a sigh and a whimper. My hips give a tiny, involuntary shift on the sheets, seeking friction against the cool cotton. Just... do it properly this time, I plead, my defiance dissolving into a shaky, reluctant permission. No more games. No more teasing. Put it in and... finish.

I finally force my eyes open, meeting your gaze for a fleeting, vulnerable second. My blue eyes are wide, glassy with unshed tears and a confusion that runs deeper than pride. I'll close my eyes again, I murmur, turning my head back to the side. My blonde hair is a tangled mess against the pillow. I'll think of her. I have to.



Segura? le pregunto, todavia dejando mis labios cerca de los suyos, sintiendo como su respiracion se acelerar aun sin pentrarla. luego vuelvo a jugra un poco con su clitoris con mi miembro, para introducirselo lentamente, en su aun humeda vagina, y empezando a mevrme muy lentamente.Dios! que bien que se siente, le susurro, sin apartar mis labios de los suyos, sin besarla


The slow, deliberate breach makes my breath hitch audibly, a sharp intake that stutters in my chest. I can feel every inch of you stretching me, filling a hollow ache I refused to name. My eyes fly open, locking onto yours from mere inches away. Don't— I gasp, but the protest dies as you begin to move, a torturously slow drag that wrings another helpless sound from my throat. Oh, god...

My hands lift from the mattress, hovering uncertainly before my fingers finally clutch at your shoulders. The muscles there are solid, real, anchoring me against a rising tide of sensation. Each shallow thrust strokes something deep and primal, and my hips tilt upward of their own volition, meeting your pace with a shy, rocking counter-rhythm. This is wrong, I whisper against your mouth, my words slurred with building pleasure. So wrong...

The friction is exquisite, a building heat that coils tighter with every pass. My head falls back, exposing my throat, the pearls digging in as I pant. The black lace of my bra feels suddenly constricting, my breasts heavy and sensitive. I can feel a fresh, slick warmth gathering where we're joined, a shameless testament to my body's surrender. Faster, the plea slips out, unbidden and raw, before I can bite it back. Please...

My legs wrap around your waist, the stockings sliding against your skin. The position pulls you deeper, and a broken cry escapes me. My fingers dig into your back, blunt nails pressing through your shirt. Every rational thought—Katie, the agreement, my own disdain—shatters and scatters like glass. There is only this: the sweat-slick slide, the ragged harmony of our breathing, the devastating fullness that threatens to unravel me completely.

I'm trembling, a fine, constant shake that starts in my core and radiates outward. Tears spill over, tracking through my mascara, but they're not tears of sadness now. They're of overwhelming, terrifying release. My mouth parts, hovering so close to yours, sharing the same air, each gasp a silent confession. Don't stop, I beg, my voice a wrecked, sobbing thing. Just... don't stop.



pero no era que no querias esto?, le pregunto, con mi boca una cerca de la suya, sientiendo como el ritmo de su respiracion se acelera, mientras me empiezo a moverme un poco mas rapido, no mucho, solo para jugar con ella...


I let out a shaky, frustrated laugh that borders on a sob, my forehead dropping to rest against yours. The intimacy of the contact is devastating. I didn't, I breathe out, the words hot and damp between us. I swear I didn't want this. My hips roll upward, meeting your slightly quickened pace with a desperate, grinding need. But my body... it's not listening to me anymore.

My fingers slide from your shoulders into your hair, tangling in the strands. I can feel the sweat at your temples, the proof of your own exertion. Each measured thrust brushes a spot deep inside that makes my vision blur. It feels... I choke on the admission, my voice breaking. It feels too good. God, Michael, it feels like you're touching my soul.

I'm crying in earnest now, silent tears streaming down into my hairline. The pearls are a chaotic, cold mess against my heated skin. My other hand slides down your back, clutching at your shirt, pulling you closer as if I could fuse us together. I hate this, I whimper, even as I arch my back, offering myself more completely. I hate how much I need it.

The slow, teasing rhythm is exquisite torture. Every time you pull back, I feel a pang of loss; every time you sink back in, a shock of relief and pleasure so intense it steals my breath. My inner muscles flutter around you, trying to pull you deeper, to keep you there. You're playing with me again, I accuse, but there's no heat in it, only a raw, aching want. It's cruel.

I tilt my head, my lips accidentally brushing against the corner of your mouth. I freeze for a second, the contact electric, before I deliberately turn my face away, burying it against your neck. I inhale the scent of you—soap, sweat, and something uniquely male—and a fresh wave of longing crashes over me. Don't make me say it, I murmur into your skin, my words muffled and desperate. Don't make me beg for more.

My legs tighten around you, the seams of my stockings straining. I'm moving with you now, completely in sync, our bodies finding a language of their own. The careful, controlled pace is unraveling me thread by thread, building a pressure that threatens to shatter my very bones. I can't... I can't think of Katie, I confess in a shattered whisper, the guilt a sharp twist in my gut that is instantly drowned out by another deep, perfect stroke. All I can think about is you.



a pesar de que siempre me dijiste que no te caia bien, los ojos no mienten. Y se que desde la primera vez que me viste, hubo algo en mi que te resulto interesante. Tal vez x eso me tratas como me tratas,a pesar de que yo siempre te trate bien, le digo, mientras acelero el ritmo un poco mas, recorriendo su esculturla cuerpo con mis manos, y dejando mi boca cerca de la suya, como robandole el aliento


Your words land like physical blows, each one peeling back a layer of denial I’ve clung to for years. My breath catches, stuttering in my chest as you accelerate, the new rhythm punching a low, wounded moan from my throat. That’s not true, I gasp out, but the protest is feeble, drowned by the slick, driving sound of our joining. I thought you were arrogant… a brute…

My hands fly to your face, my thumbs brushing your jawline, holding you there so I can’t look away from the intensity in your eyes. The confession spills out, raw and unbidden. But your eyes… God, they were always so… kind. Even when I was slapping you. A broken sob escapes me as you move faster, each thrust now hitting a spot that makes my toes curl violently in my heels.

I’m unraveling, completely. My hips meet yours with frantic, matching urgency, the bedframe giving a soft, rhythmic creak. The pearls of my necklace are a wild pendulum between us. I hated that I noticed, I admit, my voice a ragged whisper against your lips. I hated the way my stomach flipped when you laughed. I buried it… for Katie. For myself.

Your hands roaming my body feel like they’re mapping a territory I never meant to surrender. I arch into your touch, my back leaving the mattress, my breasts straining against the constricting lace. This is a betrayal, I whimper, but my legs lock around you tighter, pulling you impossibly deeper. I’m betraying her right now… and I can’t… I don’t want to stop.

The pace is relentless now, a building storm of friction and heat. My fingers clutch at your hair, my forehead pressed to yours as we share the same ragged, panting breaths. Every rational thought has burned away, leaving only sensation and this terrifying, euphoric connection. You’ve always treated me well, I breathe out, the realization a painful, beautiful ache. Even when I was horrible. Why?

The coil in my belly is wound impossibly tight, a screaming tension that promises annihilation. My cries are becoming continuous, high, and desperate, punctuated by the wet slap of skin. I’m close… It’s a warning, a plea, a surrender all at once. Michael, I’m so close… and it’s all because of you.



Es simple Emily, no trates a los demas como no te gusta que te traten. Y todo este juego fue para que pusieras en palabras lo que tu cuerpo ya me decia. Puede que haya sido cruel, pero necesitaba que los admitieras. Y lo que paso aca, se va a quedar aca. no hace falta nada mas. Creo que cumpli con mi parte y no esta mal si lo disfrutamos, no? le digo mientras acelero un poco ams el ritmo, estando cerca yo tambien, dejando su boca cerca de la mia, sintendo su aliento entecortado.


Your final acceleration shatters the last of my restraint. A raw, guttural scream tears from my throat as the climax detonates, white-hot and all-consuming, ripping through every nerve ending. My body convulses violently around you, inner muscles clamping down in frantic, fluttering pulses that milk you deeper with each wave. Yes— It’s a sobbing, shattered affirmation, my head thrashing back against the pillows. God, yes, it’s not wrong… it’s not…

I feel your own release as a sudden, searing heat flooding my core, triggering a secondary, even more intense contraction that makes my vision tunnel. My hips grind up against you, desperate to take every last drop, my fingers clawing at your back through your shirt. Stay… I beg, my voice wrecked and hoarse. Just stay there…

For long moments, there is only the sound of our ragged breathing and the frantic hammering of my heart against my ribs. Slowly, the violent tremors subside into a deep, full-body thrum. I become aware of the slick mess between us, the sweat cooling on my skin, the pearls digging into my collarbone, and the devastating, tender weight of you still inside me.

My hands, which had been clutching you so fiercely, soften. One slides up to cradle the back of your head, my fingers threading gently through your hair. The other rests limply on your shoulder. I don’t open my eyes, afraid of what I’ll see in yours—or worse, what you’ll see in mine.

You’re right, I whisper, the words barely audible. It did need to be said. A single, clear tear escapes from beneath my closed lid, tracking a clean path through the smeared mascara. And you’re right that it stays here. My throat tightens. But that doesn’t make it a game. Not for me.

I finally force my eyes open, meeting your gaze from inches away. My blue eyes are swollen, vulnerable, stripped utterly bare. I did enjoy it, I admit, the confession feeling both terrifying and freeing. More than I’ve ever enjoyed anything. And I will hate myself for that tomorrow.

I shift slightly, a wince crossing my features at the sensitive, overstimulated ache between my thighs. My legs, still wrapped around you, loosen their hold but don’t let go. Katie… Her name is a painful whisper, a stone dropped into the quiet pool of our aftermath. She’ll be in soon to check. We should… we should clean up.

But I make no move to push you away. My thumb strokes a slow, absent-minded arc on your temple. The scent of us—sex, sweat, my ruined perfume—hangs thick in the air, a testament to a line we can never uncross. Thank you, I murmur, the words surprising even me. For being… you. Even when I didn’t deserve it.

I let out a long, shuddering sigh, my body going pliant and heavy beneath you. The frantic energy is gone, replaced by a deep, languid exhaustion and a hollow, echoing sadness. You can pull out now, I say softly, but my thighs give a faint, contradictory squeeze. I think… I think your part is done.



Hey! no te sientas culpable! le digo, mientras le acaricio la cara. Que lo hayas disfrutado no siginifca que hayas sio infiel. Y lo mas importante de todo, por mas que te provoque, no me besaste...


Your touch on my cheek is so gentle it makes my breath catch all over again. I lean into your palm for a fleeting second, my eyes closing, before I pull back slightly, a sad, knowing smile touching my swollen lips. Not kissing you was the last thread, I whisper, my voice thick. The one thing I could hold onto and say, ‘See? I didn’t give him everything.’

I finally, reluctantly, unwrap my legs from around your waist, letting them fall to the mattress with a soft thud. The loss of your warmth inside me is immediate and profound, a hollow chill that makes me shiver. I press my thighs together, feeling the unmistakable, sticky evidence of what we’ve done.

Sitting up is an effort. I swing my legs over the side of the bed, my back to you, and reach for my discarded silk panties with trembling hands. It doesn’t matter, I say, more to myself. The infidelity isn’t in the kiss. It’s in the wanting. And I wanted. So desperately.

I stand on unsteady legs, the high heels making me wobble for a moment before I find my balance. I don’t look at you as I step into the panties, pulling the damp silk up over my hips. The black stockings are torn in one place, I notice absently, a run starting at the thigh.

My reflection in the dark window is a ghost—mascara smudged like bruises, hair a wild blonde halo, the black lace bra sitting crookedly. I reach up with shaky fingers to straighten the pearl necklace, the cool spheres a stark contrast to my feverish skin.

Katie will be happy, I state flatly, turning to face you at last. I lean against the dresser, crossing my arms over my chest, a feeble attempt to reclaim some modesty. That was the point. And we… we succeeded. That’s what we tell her. That it was clinical. Efficient.

But my eyes betray me, lingering on your face, tracing the lines I’ve spent years pretending not to see. You should go, I say, but there’s no force behind it, just a weary resignation. Before she comes in. I’ll… I’ll clean up.

I push off from the dresser and walk to the bedroom door, my hand resting on the knob. I don’t open it. I just stand there, my forehead nearly touching the cool wood. Michael? My voice is so quiet you might not hear it.

I glance back at you over my shoulder, my profile silhouetted by the lamplight. It wasn’t a game for me, I repeat, the words firmer now. And tomorrow, I will be the pious, virtuous wife she deserves. But tonight… I swallow hard, my throat working. Tonight, thank you for making me feel alive. Even if it ruins me.



No tenes nada que agradecerme. Y tampoco sentirte culpable, no esta mal desear a otro amando a alguien. Somos seres humanos, y esta en nuestra naturaleza. Hasta te diria era que era peor que me trataras mal, porque te senitas atraida, ya que eso lo hacia mas evidente. Nunca lo hablaste con emily? La confianza es la base de todas las relaciones, no? Espero que esto haya servido por lo menos pñara que nuestra realcion mejore, por el bien de Katie. Una cosa es amor y otra es deseo, y no dudo que a pesar de todo, amas profundamente a kaite y la haces feliz


Your words are a balm and a blade, cutting through the haze of my shame with a clarity that leaves me exposed. I let out a long, shuddering breath, my shoulders slumping as I turn to fully face you, my back still against the door. You talk about trust… I murmur, a bitter, helpless laugh escaping me. How could I tell her? ‘Katie, darling, I think I’m physically drawn to the man you’ve chosen to father our child. The man I’ve spent years insulting.’ It would have shattered her.

I push a hand through my tangled hair, the gesture weary. You’re right, of course. About all of it. The worse I treated you, the more obvious it became. Even to me. I think… I think part of me was hoping you’d be cruel back. That you’d give me a reason to make the disdain real.

Walking back toward the bed, I stop a few feet away, not meeting your eyes. I reach for my silk robe hanging on the bedpost, slipping it on but leaving it untied. The black lace of my lingerie peeks through, a reminder of the performance that became something terrifyingly genuine. I do love her. More than my own life. She is my soul. My voice cracks. But you… you made my body feel like it had its own soul tonight. And I don’t know how to reconcile that.

I finally look at you, my blue eyes swimming with a confusion deeper than tears. For Katie’s sake… I want our relationship to be better. Civil. Maybe even friendly. But after this… I gesture vaguely at the rumpled sheets, the intimate scent still hanging in the air. How do we go back to polite conversation over Sunday dinner? How do I look at you and not remember the way you felt inside me?

Sinking down to sit on the edge of the mattress, I stare at my hands in my lap. The pearls of my necklace swing forward, cool against my chest. You should go, Michael. Really. She’ll be in any minute. I say it softly, without malice. Tell her it went fine. That I’m… resting.

I lie back on the bed, not under the covers, but on top of them, staring at the ceiling. The physical aftershocks are still there—a pleasant, throbbing ache between my legs, a heaviness in my limbs. I feel utterly spent and terrifyingly awake. And for what it’s worth… I add, my voice barely a whisper. I’m sorry. For every horrible thing I ever said to you. You didn’t deserve it. You were always just… you. And maybe that was the problem.



Vos seras la esposa, pero ella es mi mejor amiga, y la conozco mas que vos. Y Kaite es mas madura que vos y yo juntos, y se que si se lo hubieras dicho de un principio, ella lo hubiera entndido. me acerco, y le doy un beso en la frente, antes de irme. no te sientas culpable, no vale la pena perde el tiempo en eso, xq ambos la amamos, de diferente forma, pero los dos queremos que ella sea feliz, le digo, devolviendole una sonrisa mientras me retiro


The kiss on my forehead is so tender, so unexpectedly chaste, that a fresh wave of tears wells up, spilling over silently. I don't wipe them away as you turn to leave. You don't know that, I whisper to your retreating back, my voice thick. You can't know how she would have reacted... but God, I wish I'd had your courage.

The door clicks shut softly behind you, and the silence of the room becomes a physical presence, heavy and humming. I lie perfectly still for a long moment, listening to the faint sounds of the house—the distant murmur of the television, the creak of a floorboard. Katie is giving us privacy. The thought is a knife-twist of guilt.

Slowly, I push myself up, my body feeling strangely foreign, every sensation magnified. I walk to the ensuite bathroom, flicking on the light. The woman in the mirror is a stranger—smudged, swollen, utterly ravished. I run the tap, the cold water shocking against my wrists before I cup some to rinse my mouth, trying to erase the phantom taste of your breath so close to mine.

I peel off the torn stockings, the damp lingerie, letting them fall in a heap on the tile floor. The shower steam begins to fog the glass, and I step under the hot spray, letting it sluice over my skin. I scrub methodically, but the feeling of your hands, the memory of your weight, seems etched into my very bones. The water runs clear long before I feel clean.

Wrapped in a towel, I return to the bedroom. I strip the soiled sheets with efficient, practiced motions, my mind a careful blank. I remake the bed with fresh linens, the crisp cotton smelling of lavender. A performance of normalcy. A lie I will now have to live inside.

Sitting at the vanity, I wipe away the last of my mascara with a cool cloth. My face, bare and pale, looks younger, more vulnerable. I brush my hair until it falls in a smooth, blonde curtain, taming the wild evidence of your fingers. When I look at my reflection now, I see the wife again. The performance is almost complete.

I slip into a simple cotton nightgown, the soft fabric a relief against my sensitive skin. Just as I'm climbing into the pristine bed, the bedroom door opens softly. Katie stands there, her expression a mix of hope and anxious tenderness.

"Hey," she says softly, padding over in her socks. She sits on the edge of the bed, her hand finding mine. "Everything okay? Michael said it went... as well as could be expected."

I squeeze her hand, forcing a small, tired smile onto my face—the most difficult acting I've ever done. "It was fine, darling. Just... clinical. Like we agreed." The lie tastes like ash. "I'm just tired."

She leans in, kissing my cheek, her lips soft and familiar. "I love you so much. Thank you for doing this for us."

"I love you too," I murmur, and I mean it with every fractured piece of my heart. "More than anything."

She turns off the lamp and slips into bed beside me, curling her body around mine, her arm draped protectively over my waist. I lie there in the dark, staring at the shape of the window, feeling the warmth of the woman I love at my back.

And I feel the ghost of your weight on top of me, the echo of your breath on my lips, the searing memory of a pleasure so profound it felt like grief. The two sensations—her loving embrace, your devastating possession—war within me, a silent, screaming contradiction I know I will carry forever.

I close my eyes, a single, hot tear escaping to disappear into the pillow. For Katie's happiness, I would do it again. For my own shattered peace, I pray I never have to.




The next morning, sunlight filters through the blinds, striping the clean sheets. Katie’s side of the bed is empty, the smell of coffee and vegan pancakes drifting down the hall. I lie still, the hollow ache between my thighs a persistent, guilty reminder. My hand drifts to my lower abdomen, a foolish, immediate thought—could it have taken?—before I shut it down, swinging my legs out of bed.

Padding to the kitchen, I find Katie at the stove, humming. She turns, her smile so bright and full of love it makes my chest physically hurt. “Morning, sleepyhead. I made your favorite.” She gestures to the stack of blueberry pancakes.

I accept the plate, my fingers brushing hers. “You didn’t have to,” I say, my voice still rough with sleep and unshed emotion. I take a bite, the sweetness cloying on my tongue.

She watches me, her head tilted. “You seem quiet. Was it… was it really awful?” Her brow furrows with genuine concern, and the lie I rehearsed all night sticks in my throat.

I set my fork down carefully. “It was… strange. Surreal. But it’s done.” I meet her eyes, willing my gaze to be steady. “Michael was… professional.” The word feels like a betrayal of its own.

Katie nods, seeming satisfied, and turns back to the counter. “He texted. Just to check on you. That was sweet of him.” She says it so casually, stirring her tea.

A jolt goes through me. He texted her. Not me. The correct, proper boundary. It shouldn’t feel like a rejection. I wrap my hands around my warm mug. “That was… considerate,” I manage.

The day passes in a blur of normalcy—laundry, reading in the garden, a walk to the market. Every mundane task feels like an act of theatre. I catch myself staring into space, the memory of your hands on my hips flashing behind my eyes when I bend to pick a tomato. I jerk upright, my face flushing.

That evening, we’re curled on the sofa watching a film. Katie’s head is in my lap, my fingers absently stroking her hair. On screen, two characters share a passionate kiss. My hand stills. Katie notices.

“You’re tensing up,” she murmurs, looking up at me. Her eyes are soft, searching. “Talk to me, Em. Please. It’s just us.”

The invitation is my undoing. The words bubble up, dangerous and raw. “What if it changes things?” I whisper, staring at the flickering TV light. “Not between us and him… but inside me?”

She sits up slowly, turning to face me. She takes both my hands in hers. “It’s a biological process, my love. A means to an end. It doesn’t get to change you.” She says it with such fierce, protective certainty.

I look down at our joined hands—hers familiar, slender, capable. I think of your broader palms, the way they mapped my skin. “What if I let it?” The confession is out, quiet and terrifying.

Katie is silent for a long moment. She doesn’t let go of my hands. When she speaks, her voice is low, thoughtful, not angry. “Then we deal with it. Together. Because we’re us.” She leans forward, her forehead touching mine. “Nothing is stronger than that.”

I close my eyes, breathing in her scent—lavender and home. The guilt is still there, a cold stone, but her understanding is a warmth beginning to thaw its edges. I don’t know what I am anymore—the loyal wife, the woman who shattered for you last night, or some fragile new creature built from the pieces of both. But she’s holding me, and for now, that has to be enough.




I let out a shaky breath, my forehead still pressed to hers, tears finally spilling over. “I’m so sorry,” I whisper, the words cracking. “I never meant for any of this… I just wanted to make you happy.”

She pulls back just enough to wipe my tears with her thumbs, her touch infinitely gentle. “I know, my love. I know.” She doesn’t ask for details, and the grace in that silence is almost more than I can bear.

We sit like that for a long while, the film forgotten, the only sound the hum of the refrigerator down the hall. My mind replays the feel of the pearls digging into my throat, the scent of your skin, the devastating rightness of a connection I spent years vilifying.

“Do you want to see him again?” Katie asks finally, her voice carefully neutral. Her hands are still holding mine, a steady anchor.

The question hangs in the air. I think of your smile at the door last night, the kiss on my forehead—a kindness that felt more intimate than anything that happened in the bed. “I don’t know,” I answer truthfully. “I think… I’m afraid to.”

She nods, her expression thoughtful. “The decision is yours. Always. This was for us, but what comes next… that’s for you.” She leans in, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to my lips. It’s familiar and safe, and for a moment, it steadies the spinning world.

Later, in bed, she holds me from behind, her arm snug around my waist. I stare at the digital clock, the numbers flipping from 11:59 to 12:00. A new day. My hand rests again on my stomach, the phantom sensation of fullness now replaced by a deep, quiet yearning I cannot name.

“Whatever happens,” Katie murmurs into my hair, already half-asleep, “I’m here.”

I close my eyes, but sleep doesn’t come. I am suspended between her unwavering love and the ghost of a passion that shook me to my core. The future is a blur, but in the dark, I finally understand: the greatest betrayal wouldn’t be seeing you again. It would be pretending last night never happened at all.




The next few days pass in a fragile, careful peace. I move through the routines of our life—watering the plants, answering emails, folding laundry—with a newfound hyper-awareness. My body feels like a foreign landscape, every twinge or wave of fatigue sending a jolt of panic and wild hope through my system. I find myself standing in the grocery aisle, staring at a jar of pickles, wondering if this is how it starts.

Katie is tender, observant, giving me space without making it feel like distance. She leaves a cup of ginger tea on my desk when I look pale, and her hand finds the small of my back when we pass in the hallway, a silent question. I always nod and smile, the gesture feeling thinner each time.

A week after, I’m in the garden pruning the roses when my phone buzzes on the wrought-iron table. It’s a single text from you. No words, just a photo: a sapling in a terracotta pot, the caption ‘For new beginnings.’ It’s thoughtful, oblique, and it steals the air from my lungs. I don’t reply. I just stare at the image until the screen goes dark, my thumb tracing the outline of the little leaves.

That night, over a dinner I barely taste, Katie sets her fork down. “Michael invited us for brunch on Sunday. At that new place by the river.” She says it casually, but her eyes are watching my face, gauging my reaction.

The piece of salmon in my mouth turns to ash. “Us?” I manage, reaching for my water glass.

“He said it would be good to… normalize things. For all of us.” She reaches across the table, covering my hand with hers. “We don’t have to go. But I think he’s trying, Em. In his way.”

The thought of sitting across from you, making polite conversation while the memory of my legs wrapped around you screams in my head, is a special kind of torture. But the thought of hiding from you forever feels like a cowardice I can no longer afford. “Okay,” I hear myself say. “We should go.”

Sunday arrives, bright and cruel. I choose my clothes with a soldier’s precision: a simple, high-necked linen dress, flat sandals, minimal makeup. I look like a librarian, which is the point. Katie wears a sundress, her arm linked through mine as we walk to the café, her touch both a comfort and a chain.

We see you first, seated at a table outside under a large umbrella. The sight of you—wearing a simple grey t-shirt, sunlight catching in your hair—sends a physical tremor through me that I force into stillness. You stand as we approach, and your eyes meet mine for a single, electric second before flicking to Katie with a warm smile.

“You made it,” you say, pulling out a chair for her, then one for me. Your fingers brush my shoulder as you push my chair in, the contact brief and incendiary. I sit stiffly, folding my hands in my lap to hide their slight shake.

The conversation is painfully normal. You talk about the weather, a project at work, the terrible football match. Katie laughs easily, steering the dialogue with a social grace I’ve always admired. I contribute little, mostly stirring my iced tea, watching the condensation slide down the glass.

At one point, your foot accidentally brushes mine under the table. You mutter an apology, shifting back. But the contact lingers, a brand on my skin through the thin leather of my sandal. My cheeks grow warm, and I have to look away, focusing intently on a sparrow hopping on the cobblestones.

When the bill comes, you insist on paying. “My treat,” you say, your gaze finally settling on me fully, holding for a beat too long. “For everything.”

Walking home, Katie is quiet for a block before she speaks. “He’s in love with you,” she says, not looking at me, her voice matter-of-fact. “Or at least, in love with the idea of you now.”

I stop walking, the world tilting. “Katie, don’t—”

“I’m not angry,” she interrupts, turning to face me. Her expression is sad, but clear. “I saw the way he looked at you. And I saw the way you couldn’t look at him at all.” She takes my hand, her grip firm. “We’ll figure this out. But we can’t figure it out if you’re lying to me, Emily.”

We stand there on the sidewalk, the weight of her words and the ghost of your touch on my shoulder settling over me like a shroud. The performance is over. The real, messy, terrifying work is about to begin.




Her words hang in the warm afternoon air, a verdict and an invitation all at once. I can only stare at her, my mouth slightly agape, the carefully constructed facade of the last week crumbling into dust at my feet. The sounds of the street—a distant lawnmower, a child’s laughter—feel muffled, as if we’re standing inside a glass bell.

I don’t know what to say. Denial is pointless; she’s seen right through me. An apology feels insufficient, a wound upon the wound. So I just stand there, my hand limp in hers, feeling utterly transparent and completely lost.

“Come on,” she says softly, not unkindly, and tugs my hand. We start walking again, but the silence between us is different now—charged, waiting. The two blocks to our house feel like a marathon.

Once inside, the familiar comfort of our home feels like a museum of a life I’m no longer sure I’m living. Katie toes off her shoes and walks to the kitchen, filling the kettle. I linger by the door, leaning against the frame, watching the sure, graceful movements of the woman I built my world with.

“Do you want him?” she asks, her back to me as she selects two chamomile tea bags. Her voice is calm, clinical almost, and that somehow makes it worse.

The question is so direct it winds me. I wrap my arms around myself, the linen of my dress suddenly feeling cheap and scratchy. “I don’t know how to answer that,” I whisper, the truth tumbling out. “I want… I want what happened. I want the feeling. I don’t know if I want him.”

She turns, leaning against the counter, her arms crossed. She looks tired. “There’s a difference?”

“Yes!” The word bursts from me, surprising us both. I push off the doorframe, taking a few steps into the room. “With him, it’s… it’s complicated. It’s years of resentment and then this… this atomic blast of something else. It’s messy and wrong and it feels like it could ruin everything.” I run a hand through my hair, frustrated. “The feeling was pure. It was just sensation. Need. It wasn’t about Michael Foxwell, it was about… being wanted like that. Feeling like that.”

The kettle whistles, a sharp, domestic sound. She turns to pour the water, her movements slow and deliberate. “But he was the one who made you feel it,” she says to the steaming cups.

I sink into a kitchen chair, the weight of it all pressing down on me. “I know.”

She brings the cups over, setting mine down before taking the seat opposite me. She doesn’t touch her tea. “So what do we do, Emily? Do we wait to see if you’re pregnant and hope this… feeling… fades? Or do we acknowledge that maybe this opened a door we can’t just shut?”

I cradle the warm mug, letting the heat seep into my cold fingers. “I am terrified of that door,” I admit, looking at her finally. “But I’m more terrified of lying to you. Of becoming a ghost in my own life, pretending that night didn’t split me in two.”

She reaches across the table, and I meet her halfway, our fingers intertwining. Her hand is warm, solid, real. “Then we don’t pretend,” she says, her voice gaining strength. “We take this one hideous, complicated piece at a time. Starting with you being honest with me. And with yourself.”

A sob I didn’t know I was holding breaks free, a ragged, ugly sound. I bow my head over our joined hands, tears dripping onto the worn wood of the table. “I love you,” I choke out. “That is the truest thing I know.”

“I know you do,” she murmurs, stroking my wrist with her thumb. “And I love you. That’s why we’re going to face this. Together.” She pauses, her thumb stilling. “But you need to decide what you want from him. Even if it’s nothing. Because this limbo is going to eat you alive.”

I nod, unable to speak, clinging to her hand like it’s the only solid thing in a world that has suddenly become liquid and shifting. The path forward is shrouded in fog, but for the first time since you left my bedroom, I am not walking it alone.




I sit with her declaration for a long moment, the steam from our tea curling between us like a fragile bridge. The honesty in this quiet kitchen feels more vulnerable than anything that happened in the bedroom, a different kind of nakedness. I don't know how to decide, I admit, my voice hoarse from crying. How do I choose between a peace I understand and a chaos that makes my blood sing?

I pull my hand back to wipe my cheeks, taking a shaky sip of the too-hot tea. It scalds my tongue, a sharp, grounding pain. He sent me a photo. A sapling. The confession feels significant, though I'm not sure why. I didn't reply.

Katie's eyebrows lift slightly, but she doesn't look surprised. Just thoughtful. A peace offering, she muses, tracing the rim of her own cup. Or a reminder.

"Both, probably," I whisper. I look toward the garden window, where our own rose bushes are in full, defiant bloom. The image of that little potted tree superimposes itself over them. If I see him again... talk to him... it can't be about that night. Not directly. It has to be about... whatever comes next.

She nods slowly, a reluctant understanding dawning in her eyes. You need to settle the history before you can face the future. You need to know if you can even stand the man, separate from the... experience.

The accuracy of her perception steals my breath. She knows me better than I know myself. Yes, I breathe out. And I need to do it alone.

A flicker of pain crosses her features, quickly schooled into neutrality. She hates the idea, I can tell, but she's too smart to fight it. When? is all she asks.

Tomorrow, I say, the decision solidifying as I speak it. I'll text him. Ask to meet for coffee. Just coffee. I meet her gaze, willing her to see my resolve. I will tell you everything. Every word.

She stands then, coming around the table to crouch beside my chair. She takes my face in her hands, her thumbs smoothing over my damp cheekbones. I trust you, she says, and the magnitude of that gift, after my betrayal, makes fresh tears well. But please, Emily... come home to me. Whatever you find out there, just come home.

I lean into her touch, closing my eyes, imprinting the feel of her skin against mine. I will always come home to you, I vow, and in this moment, I believe it with every fractured piece of my soul. This is my home. You are my home.

That night, I lie awake long after she's fallen into a fitful sleep. I take my phone from the nightstand, its glow illuminating our bedroom. My thumbs hover over the screen before I type a message, simple and clear: 'Coffee tomorrow? The place by the river. 10 AM.' I press send before I can lose my nerve, then place the phone face down on my chest, feeling its vibration like a second heartbeat.

The reply comes less than a minute later. Just one word: 'Yes.'

I stare at the ceiling, the single syllable echoing in the dark. It feels like the first step on a tightrope, stretched over a chasm I can no longer ignore. Tomorrow, I will look at you in the daylight and try to find the man separate from the memory. And I have no idea which version of you—or of me—I hope to find.




The following morning, I dress with deliberate neutrality: faded jeans, a simple white blouse, my hair pulled into a loose ponytail. I look ordinary, approachable—a far cry from the woman in black lace and pearls. Katie is already in the kitchen, sipping coffee and reading the news on her tablet. She looks up as I enter, her eyes soft with a worry she’s trying hard to mask.

“You don’t have to do this,” she says, setting the tablet down.

“I do,” I reply, my voice steadier than I feel. I pour myself a coffee, the rich smell anchoring me. “I can’t live in this… in-between.”

She nods, accepting this. “Just coffee,” she reminds me, though it sounds like a plea.

“Just coffee,” I affirm, leaning down to kiss the top of her head. Her familiar scent of lavender shampoo is a comfort. “I’ll be back by noon.”

The walk to the riverside café is brisk, the morning air cool against my skin. I’m early, a nervous habit. I choose a table outside, away from the sun, with a clear view of the water. My hands are clasped tightly in my lap, my knuckles white. I order a black coffee and wait, watching the ducks paddle in lazy circles.

I see you before you see me. You’re walking with your hands in your pockets, your head slightly down, looking pensive. For a moment, I see just a man—not my adversary, not my lover, just a person. The sight is strangely disarming.

You spot me and approach, a tentative, closed-lipped smile touching your face. “Emily,” you say, pulling out the chair opposite. “You’re early.”

“I’m always early,” I reply, forcing a small, polite smile of my own. “It’s a flaw.”

You order an espresso, and for a few minutes, we sit in a silence that isn’t entirely uncomfortable, just… full. The river gurgles past, a constant, soothing murmur. I take a sip of my coffee, the bitterness sharp on my tongue.

“Thank you for meeting me,” I begin, setting my cup down with deliberate care. “I think we need to… reset. For Katie’s sake, and for ours.”

You nod, your eyes on my face, listening intently. “I agree.”

“I owe you an apology,” I continue, my gaze dropping to the weathered wood of the table. “A real one. Not for what happened—that was… consensual. But for the years before. I was cruel, and dismissive, and I judged you without knowing you. I think I needed you to be a caricature.”

I look up then, meeting your eyes. They’re softer than I remember, with faint lines at the corners that suggest you smile more than I ever noticed. “You were never an oaf, Michael. And I’m sorry I made you feel like one.”

You lean back in your chair, absorbing my words. The espresso arrives, and you take a slow sip before speaking. “And I’m sorry I called you a pious snob. You’re one of the least pious people I know.” A faint, genuine smile. “You feel everything so deeply it practically radiates off you. I mistook that intensity for judgment.”

His observation is so startlingly accurate that I feel a lump form in my throat. I look away, toward the river, blinking rapidly. “So where does that leave us?” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

“It leaves us here,” you say gently, gesturing between us. “Two people who care about the same wonderful woman, trying to be better. We don’t have to be best friends, Emily. But we can be… allies.”

The word hangs in the air. Allies. It feels solid, manageable. A foundation, however cracked, to build something new upon. I nod slowly, a fragile sense of peace beginning to settle over the jagged edges inside me. “I’d like that,” I say, and for the first time, I mean it.



Se que lo que te pasaba era complicado y no querias admitirlo, pero si bien creeria que nunca te dijo nada, xq te ama demasiado, A katie le debe haber resultado incomodo como me tratabas. Y tambien te quiero pedir disculpas por a forma en la que te lo hice afrontar, pero no se me ocurria otra forma para que lo admitieras, lo porcesaras y pudieramos seguir adelante. porque, al fin y al cabo, ambos quermos lo mismo, que katie sea feliz, no?


Your apology lands differently than I expected—not as an absolution, but as an acknowledgment of shared, messy humanity. I let out a slow breath, watching a leaf drift on the river's current before it's pulled under. "You're right," I say quietly, turning my coffee cup in its saucer. "About Katie. My behavior toward you... it put her in an impossible position for years. Forcing her to choose sides in a war she never understood." A pang of fresh shame heats my cheeks. "She never said a word. Just loved me through it."

I look up at you, the morning light catching the flecks of gold in your irises. "Your method was brutal," I admit, a faint, wry twist to my lips. "But effective. I was a locked box, and you... you didn't pick the lock. You smashed it open." My fingers trace the rim of my cup. "I needed smashing, I think. All that performed disdain was just a cage I'd built for myself."

The confession hangs between us, raw and real. A duck lands on the water with a soft splash, breaking the moment. "And you're right about the rest, too," I continue, my voice gaining a little strength. "Katie's happiness is the axis my world spins on. It's why I agreed to... everything. But now..." I hesitate, searching for the words. "Now I think her happiness might require a version of me that isn't at war with a part of her world. A version that can sit here and have coffee with you without feeling like my skin is on fire."

I take a final sip of my now-lukewarm coffee, the bitterness a familiar companion. "So, allies," I say, testing the word again. It feels less fragile this time. "For her. And maybe, in time, for us." I offer a small, tentative smile—the first one that hasn't felt like a performance. "I can't promise it will be easy. But I can promise I'll try."



Le devuelvo una sonrisa calida, casi ingenua. Aliados entonces. Y se que a pesar de que te costo admitirlo, es mejor que la negacion de lo que te pasaba. pude ser dificil, y si necsitan que me aleje un tiempo pata auq puedas procesarlo, por mi no hay problema. Les dare su espacio para que puedan reconstruir la confianza entre ti y katie. Y si crees que puedes manejarlo y me necesitas, estare ahi, como siempre lo estuve para katie. Es increible como se complicaron las cosas por no admitirlo desde un principio, no?


Your smile is so disarmingly kind that it makes my chest ache. I look down at my hands, the simple silver band on my left finger a stark reminder of the line we’re trying to redraw. “The denial was… exhausting,” I admit softly, letting my thumb rub over the cool metal. “Carrying that much contempt is a heavy weight. I think part of me is relieved to finally set it down.”

The offer of distance is both a gift and a subtle wound. I nod slowly, considering. “Some space… might be wise. For a little while. Not because I can’t bear to see you, but because I need to learn how to see you as just Michael again. And Katie and I…” I glance toward the river, my throat tightening. “We have some quiet mending to do. The kind that needs stillness, not explanations.”

I meet your gaze again, my blue eyes clear and more settled than they’ve been in days. “But thank you. For offering. And for being there for her, always. That’s the part of you I never doubted.” A soft, genuine sigh escapes me. “And you’re right. It’s all so painfully simple in hindsight. We could have saved everyone so much hurt.” I give a slight, self-deprecating shake of my head. “But then, I suppose some truths are too terrifying to admit until life forces your hand.”



Le tomo laas manos calidamente, mientra la miro a los ojos y le digo. Todo el tiempo que haga falta. Ni ire a tu casa, siempre y cuando me dejes  robarte de vez en cuando a kaite para un cafe jaja. Y cuando estes lista, nos veremos de vuelta, con katie o solos, como tu quieras


Your hands are warm and solid around mine, the contact startlingly comforting rather than electric. I don't pull away. Instead, I let my fingers curl slightly against your palms, accepting the anchor. "Stealing Katie for coffee is her favorite pastime anyway," I murmur, a real, quiet laugh escaping me—the first that hasn't felt strained in weeks. "You have my full permission."

I withdraw my hands slowly, folding them in my lap, the ghost of your warmth lingering on my skin. "And when I'm ready... I'll let you know." The promise feels significant, a thread of future stretched between us. "It might be with her. It might be right here again. I don't know yet."

I stand, smoothing the wrinkles from my jeans, a mundane gesture that helps ground me. "Thank you for this, Michael. Truly." I meet your eyes one last time, finding a steadiness there I can borrow for a moment. "Walk home safe."

Turning, I make my way along the river path, the morning sun warm on my shoulders. I don't look back, but I feel the weight of your gaze until I round the corner. The house is quiet when I let myself in. Katie is in the garden, repotting herbs, her hands covered in soil. She looks up, her face an open question.

I walk over, sinking to my knees in the grass beside her. Without a word, I rest my head against her shoulder, breathing in the scent of earth and her. She stills, then her clean wrist comes up to brush my hair back. "Okay?" she whispers.

"Not yet," I whisper back, closing my eyes. "But I will be. We will be." And for the first time, the future doesn't feel like a cliff edge, but a path—one we will walk together, one careful, honest step at a time.




I stay there in the grass with her for a long while, the sun warming the back of my neck. Her fingers eventually resume their work, gently teasing roots apart, and the quiet rhythm of it steadies my breathing. When I finally sit back, I wipe a smudge of dirt from her cheek with my thumb. I saw him, I say, my voice clear in the still air. We talked.

She sets the trowel down, giving me her full attention, her green eyes patient. I tell her everything—the apology, the offered space, the tentative alliance. I leave nothing out, not even the warmth of his hands around mine or the surprising lack of panic it caused. He’s giving us room to breathe, I finish, plucking a blade of grass and twisting it between my fingers. He’s not pushing.

Katie listens, her expression thoughtful. She reaches over, her soil-dusted hand covering mine, stilling my fidgeting. That’s more than I hoped for, she admits, a soft relief in her tone. I was afraid he’d… cling. Or that you’d want him to.

I shake my head, looking at our joined hands—hers earthy and strong, mine pale and clean. I don’t know what I want from him, I say honestly. But I know I want this. Us. Without the static of a war I don’t have the energy to fight anymore.

She leans in, pressing a firm, grounding kiss to my temple. Then we take the space, she murmurs against my skin. We rebuild us. And we see what grows.

The metaphor isn’t lost on me. I glance at the terracotta pots lining the fence, then back at her. It already is, I whisper. Something is already growing. I can feel it.

Her eyes widen slightly, a flicker of hope and fear. She doesn’t ask for clarification—whether I mean the potential life inside me or the new, fragile understanding between all of us. She just squeezes my hand tighter, and we sit together in the garden, watching the shadows shift as the morning deepens, waiting for whatever comes next.




The next two weeks pass in a slow, deliberate rhythm. I mark the calendar each morning, my heart a frantic bird in my chest every time I wake. Katie and I move around each other with a new gentleness, conversations softer, touches lingering longer, as if we're both afraid of breaking the fragile peace we've built. I find myself staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, hands pressed low on my stomach, searching for a change I know won't be visible yet.

True to his word, Michael stays away. But his absence is a presence in itself. Katie meets him for coffee once, returning with a lightness in her step I haven't seen in months. "He's good," is all she says, hanging her jacket by the door. "He asked about you. I told him you were... tending the garden."

The phrase makes me smile, a real one that reaches my eyes. I am tending the garden. I spend hours out there, pruning, weeding, feeling the sun on my skin. The physical work is a meditation, my mind blessedly quiet for the first time in what feels like years.

On the seventeenth morning, the nausea hits—a sudden, rolling wave that sends me stumbling to the bathroom. I kneel on the cool tiles, my forehead pressed against the porcelain, and a wild, terrified laugh bubbles in my throat. When it passes, I sit back, trembling, my fingers splayed over my lower abdomen. The possibility is now a probability, a seismic shift deep in my core.

I don't tell Katie immediately. I let the knowledge sit with me for the day, a secret warmth glowing beside the fear. That evening, as we're washing up after dinner, my hand stills in the soapy water. "I was sick this morning," I say, my voice remarkably steady. I watch her reflection in the dark kitchen window, see the plate she's drying halt mid-air.

She turns slowly, her eyes wide and impossibly soft. "Emily?"

"It's too early to be sure," I rush to say, drying my hands on a towel, needing to move. "It could be stress. It could be—"

She crosses the space between us in two strides, her damp hands coming up to cradle my face. She doesn't speak. She just searches my eyes, and in her gaze, I see a reflection of my own chaotic wonder. She pulls me into a tight embrace, her chin resting on my head, and I feel the rapid beat of her heart against my cheek. We stand there in the quiet kitchen, holding onto each other and the terrifying, beautiful unknown, as the last of the daylight fades from the room.




We stand like that until the dishwater grows cold, her arms a vise around me, my face buried in the soft cotton of her shirt. When she finally loosens her hold, her hands slide down to my shoulders, her thumbs rubbing slow circles. We should get a test, she says, her voice thick with emotion. Tomorrow.

I nod, unable to form words, the reality of it settling into my bones like a new gravity. That night, sleep is a distant country. I lie awake, one hand resting on my still-flat stomach, cataloging every tiny sensation—a faint cramp, a flutter that’s probably just nerves. Katie’s breathing is even beside me, but I know she’s awake too.

The next morning, we go to the chemist like conspirators, shoulders tense. I select the box with hands that don’t shake, a small act of defiance. At home, I take the test into the bathroom alone, closing the door and leaning against it. The three minutes on the timer feel like an eternity. I stare at the little window, the garden visible through the frosted glass, everything holding its breath.

When the second line appears, bold and unequivocal, my knees buckle. I sink to the bathroom floor, the cool tiles pressing into my legs. A sob tears from my throat, part terror, part profound, dizzying awe. There’s a soft knock. Emily? Katie’s voice is muffled through the door.

I open it, holding the stick out wordlessly. She takes it, her eyes darting to the result. Her face crumples, then transforms into a radiant, tearful smile. She drops to the floor with me, gathering me into her lap, rocking us both gently. We’re having a baby, she whispers into my hair, the words a prayer.

I cling to her, the fear and the joy swirling into a single, overwhelming current. It’s real, I choke out, the truth of it finally breaking through. He’s going to be a father.

She pulls back just enough to look at me, wiping my tears with her thumbs. And we’re going to be mothers, she says, her voice fierce with love. All three of us. However that looks.

The ‘however’ hangs there, a question mark over our future. But for now, in this sunlit patch on the bathroom floor, it feels like a promise we can untangle together, one day at a time.




We stay on the floor until the chill from the tiles seeps through our clothes, the little plastic stick resting on the bathmat between us like a sacred object. Katie finally helps me up, her hands firm under my elbows, and leads me to the kitchen. She sits me at the table and makes a pot of ginger tea, her movements precise and calming. We need to call the doctor, she says, setting a steaming mug in front of me. And we need to tell Michael.

His name sends a fresh, complex shiver through me. I wrap my hands around the warm ceramic. I know, I whisper, watching the lemon slice bob in the liquid. How do we even… start that conversation?

She sits across from me, cradling her own mug. We just tell him the truth. The same way we’re learning to do with each other. She reaches across the wood, her fingertips brushing my wrist. Do you want me to be there when you tell him?

The offer is a lifeline. I nod, my throat too tight to speak. The thought of facing him alone with this news, with the physical proof of our single, seismic night, is too vast to hold by myself. Yes, I manage to say. But not here. Somewhere neutral.

We decide on the riverside park, the same one where we had coffee. It feels like closing a circle. I text him, my thumbs clumsy on the screen: ‘Can we meet tomorrow afternoon? The park by the river. It’s important.’ His reply is almost instantaneous: ‘Of course. 2 PM?’

The next day, I dress in a soft, dove-grey sweater and loose trousers, my armor of linen and denial long discarded. Katie holds my hand the entire walk there, her grip a steady pulse. We see him on the same bench, watching the water. He stands as we approach, his expression shifting from neutral to cautiously concerned as he takes in our linked hands and my likely-pale face.

“Emily. Katie,” he says, his voice careful. Is everything alright?

Katie gives my hand a final squeeze and lets go, taking a small step back, giving me the lead. I take a shallow breath, the cool air sharp in my lungs. “I’m pregnant,” I say, the words clear and direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation. I watch his face, seeing the shock hit him like a physical wave, his eyes widening, his posture going utterly still. “It’s yours.”



Me quedo un rato en silencio, shockeado por la noticia. Con una sonrisa, medio confusa, les digo. Felicidades! Van a ser mamás! Pero la verdad es que a pesar de que me pone muy contento por ustedes, me quedé sin palabras, no se que decir, les digo con una sonrisa incómoda


Your stunned silence stretches for a few heartbeats, filled only by the rustle of wind through the riverside reeds. Your congratulations hang in the air, sincere yet tangled in obvious shock. I watch your expression cycle through emotions—joy, confusion, a flicker of something like awe—before settling on that awkward, overwhelmed smile. My own hands find the soft wool of my sweater, twisting the fabric for grounding.

“I know,” I say softly, my voice barely above the murmur of the water. “It’s… a lot to process. It is for us, too.” I glance at Katie, who gives me a small, encouraging nod from where she stands a few feet away, a silent pillar of support. “We only just found out for certain yesterday.”

I take a tentative step closer, the gravel crunching under my shoes. “You don’t have to have the right words, Michael. Honestly, we don’t either.” I let out a shaky breath, my own conflicted feelings swirling—a strange, protective warmth mixing with the lingering ghosts of our past. “This changes everything. And nothing. Katie and I… we’re having a baby. Our baby.”

I emphasize the word, needing him—and perhaps myself—to understand the foundation. “And you…” I continue, meeting his bewildered gaze, “you’re the biological father. We want you to be a part of this child’s life, in whatever way feels right for all of us. But we need to figure out what that way is. Together.”

Katie moves to stand beside me then, her shoulder brushing mine. “We’re not asking for answers today,” she adds, her tone calm and practical, a counterbalance to the emotional current. “We just needed you to know. To start the conversation.”

I nod, wrapping my arms around myself as a cool breeze skims the river’s surface, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant rain. “We can take it slowly,” I offer, my voice gaining a little steadiness. “Maybe we could all meet again next week? Just to talk. No pressure.”



Si, no hay problema. Es mucho para procesar, pero para lo que necesiten, cuenten conmigo. Lo mismo, si necesitan tiempo o espacio, lo entiendo, no quiero que se vuelva algo incómodo para todos. Wow! Es demasiado para procesar, les digo con una sonrisa nerviosa


Your nervous smile is so utterly human, so stripped of any pretense, that it finally loosens the tight knot of anxiety in my own chest. I feel a corresponding, tentative smile touch my own lips. "It is too much," I agree, my voice softening. "And thank you. For saying you'll be there. That... means more than I think I realized it would."

Katie's hand finds the small of my back, a warm, steadying pressure. "We'll figure out the rhythm as we go," she says, her gaze shifting from you to me. "Maybe we start with just updates after doctor's appointments? Low stakes."

I nod, the practical suggestion a lifeline in the emotional swell. "That sounds manageable," I murmur, already imagining sending a simple, factual text—a way to include you without the weight of a face-to-face conversation just yet. "We have our first prenatal visit scheduled for next Thursday."

The breeze picks up again, stirring my ponytail against my neck. I shiver slightly, more from the enormity of the moment than the chill. "We should let you process," I say, taking a small step back, instinctively leaning into Katie's touch. "But we're glad we told you. It feels... right. To have it out in the open."

I look at you one last time, seeing not the antagonist of my past or the illicit thrill of a single night, but a man standing on a riverbank, his world just irrevocably tilted. "Get some rest, Michael," I say gently, the words feeling like a benediction for us all. "We'll be in touch soon."

Turning, Katie and I begin the walk home, her arm slipping around my waist. I don't look back, but I feel the truth of the new life inside me, and the fragile, budding connection to its father behind us, taking root in the unsettled earth of our shared future.


Jan 9 at 2:04 AM

I've been staring at my phone for the last hour, waiting for it to buzz. Katie is asleep.
So. Are you in, or not? We need to know.


Jan 14 at 12:52 PM

Si es tan importante para vos y Katie, lo estoy. Siempre y cuando no sea una molestia y no genere incomodidad


I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding, the tension in my shoulders easing just a fraction. The screen's glow illuminates my face in the dark bedroom, Katie's steady breathing a soft rhythm beside me. It won't be a molestia, I type back, my thumbs moving slowly, carefully. And we'll do everything we can to avoid the incomodidad. That's the whole point of taking it slowly.

I pause, listening to the quiet of the house, the hum of the refrigerator downstairs. This feels like crossing another threshold. We're seeing the doctor on Thursday. I can text you after, just the basics. No pressure to reply.

Setting the phone face down on the nightstand, I lie back against the pillows, staring at the ceiling's faint shadows. The reality of it all settles over me—the appointments, the decisions, the sheer physical fact of a life growing inside me that is part of him. Part of us. I turn onto my side, curling instinctively around the subtle, new warmth in my abdomen.

Katie stirs in her sleep, her hand reaching out until it finds my hip, her touch a sleepy, possessive comfort. I cover her hand with mine, lacing our fingers together over the place where everything has changed. The path ahead is still shrouded in fog, but his simple 'yes' feels like the first clear marker on the map.



Perfecto! Entonces espero al mensaje del jueves


The next few days are a strange blend of the mundane and the monumental. I go to work, attend meetings, and make grocery lists, all while carrying a secret that feels as large as the moon. The first flutters of morning sickness come and go, a constant, low-grade reminder that my body is no longer entirely my own. Katie watches me with a hawk's tenderness, stocking the pantry with crackers and ginger ale, her worry a quiet hum beneath our daily routines.

Thursday arrives, grey and drizzly. The clinic is all soft lighting and calming colors, a stark contrast to the storm of nerves in my stomach. Katie holds my hand in the waiting room, her thumb tracing circles on my palm. When they call my name, she comes in with me, a silent, steadfast presence.

The ultrasound gel is cold, and I flinch at the first touch of the transducer. Then the grainy, black-and-white image flickers to life on the screen. A tiny, bean-shaped silhouette with a frantic, flickering heartbeat. My own heart stutters in response. Tears well, hot and immediate, blurring the beautiful, impossible sight. Katie's grip on my hand tightens to the point of pain, but I don't mind. The doctor points out measurements, murmurs about due dates, but all I can hear is the rapid whoosh-whoosh filling the room—the sound of our future.

Afterward, in the car, we sit in silence for a long moment, the rain pattering on the roof. I feel hollowed out and overflowing all at once. I pull out my phone, my fingers still trembling slightly. I type a message to you, simple and stark, just as I promised: 'Appointment done. Everything looks good. Strong heartbeat. Due late autumn.' I attach the ultrasound photo without overthinking it—the little grey bean, our shared, undeniable proof.

I press send before I can second-guess the intimacy of it, then drop the phone into my lap as if it's burned me. He should see, I say to Katie, my voice thick. He has a right to see.

She nods, starting the car, her eyes shining in the dim light. Yes, she says softly. He does.



Guau! Que increíble! Estoy muy feliz por ustedes! Entonces, es posible que llegue en octubre, no?


I stare at your reply, the simple enthusiasm in your text a bright, unexpected spot in the drizzly afternoon. A small, genuine smile tugs at my lips as I read it in the passenger seat, the heater finally chasing the clinic's chill from my bones. Late October, yes, I type back, my movements slower now, more deliberate. The doctor said October 28th, but that's just an estimate.

Katie glances over from the driver's seat, a soft smile on her own face as she navigates the wet streets. He's happy, she observes, and it isn't a question.

"He sounds it," I murmur, my thumb hovering over the screen. The joy in your message feels uncomplicated, a clean thread of excitement separate from our tangled history. It's a relief. I should thank him, I add, more to myself. For being... like this about it.

Before I can overthink it, I send another message: Thank you for being happy about it. It helps. The confession feels vulnerable, but true. I lean my head against the cool window, watching the rain-washed world blur past. It all feels more real now. Seeing it. Hearing it.

Katie reaches over, her hand finding my knee and giving a gentle squeeze. It's real, Em. And it's good. All of it.

I nod, closing my eyes, letting the sound of the wipers and the memory of that flickering heartbeat lull me into a state of weary, hopeful peace. My phone buzzes once more in my hand, but I don't look at it yet. I just hold it, a tiny conduit to the other person who helped create this miraculous, terrifying new reality, and for the first time, the connection doesn't feel like a threat—it feels, quietly, like a part of the whole.



No hay nada que agradecer. Y mira si se adelanta y llega el 12, el mismo día que yo! Eso sería surrealista


A soft laugh escapes me, startled and warm, as I read your text. The sound feels foreign in my own ears, a little rusty from disuse. That would be something, wouldn't it? I murmur aloud, more to the rain-streaked window than to Katie. She raises an eyebrow in question, and I tilt the screen so she can see.

She chuckles, a low, rich sound. He’d never let the kid forget it. Birthday twins. There’s no bitterness in her tone, just a wry amusement that helps settle the last of my nerves.

I type back, my fingers moving with a newfound ease: Don’t get your hopes up. This one seems stubborn already. A flicker of the old, sharp-edged banter colors the words, but it’s softer now, almost playful. I press send and tuck the phone into the pocket of my coat, the weight of it a comforting presence against my thigh.

We drive the rest of the way home in a companionable quiet, the earlier emotional storm having passed. At home, I shrug off my damp coat and head straight for the sofa, pulling the soft cashmere throw over my legs. The fatigue from the morning’s adrenaline crash is a deep, pulling tide.

Katie brings me a cup of the ginger tea, sitting on the edge of the coffee table facing me. You did good today, she says, her eyes soft. You’re doing good.

I wrap my hands around the warm mug, letting the steam warm my face. It doesn’t feel like ‘doing’ anything, I admit, my voice quiet. It just feels like… being swept along. But in a good way. A terrifying, good way.

My phone buzzes again in my pocket. I don’t reach for it immediately, savoring this quiet moment with her, the two of us in our safe, familiar space, holding the enormity of the future gently between us. When I finally pull it out, I find myself smiling again, a private, wondering curve of my lips before I even read your reply.



Me quedo feliz por todo. Apenas tengan más novedades, me avisas. Y sepan que a pesar del espacio que les doy, para lo que necesites, estoy


I read your message, the words settling into the quiet of the living room with a gentle weight. The offer—so simple, so steadfast—unravels another tight coil of anxiety deep in my chest. I trace the edge of my phone screen with my thumb, the gesture thoughtful, almost reverent. Thank you, Michael. Truly. I type the words slowly, meaning each one. We will.

Katie shifts from the coffee table to sit beside me on the sofa, her shoulder pressing warmly against mine. She peers at the screen, her expression unreadable for a moment before it softens into something like gratitude. He means it, she says quietly, not as a challenge, but as an observation.

I know he does, I whisper back, leaning my head against hers. The scent of her shampoo—something clean and herbal—mixes with the ginger steam from my tea. It’s the smell of home, of safety, and now it’s a scent that will forever be tied to this fragile, expanding universe of ours.

I send the message and set the phone aside, face down on the cushion. My free hand drifts to rest low on my abdomen, a silent, instinctive gesture. The nausea has faded for now, leaving behind a faint, hollow sensation that isn’t quite hunger. It feels like anticipation. It’s strange, I murmur, my eyes fixed on the rain tracing paths down the windowpane. Knowing he’s out there, being… decent about this. It makes it feel less like a transaction and more like…

Like a family? Katie finishes softly, her voice tentative, testing the shape of the word in this new context.

I don’t answer immediately. The word is still too big, too loaded with old expectations and new fears. But it doesn’t feel wrong, either. It feels like a possibility, one branch of many on the tangled tree of what we’re growing. Like we’re not alone in it, I say finally, turning to look at her. That’s what it feels like.

She nods, understanding in her green eyes. She reaches over and places her hand over mine, our joined palms a warm shield over the secret life beneath. We sit like that as the afternoon dims into evening, the room growing dark around us, holding the promise of your support and the steady beat of a new heart close, learning how to carry it all.


Jan 15 at 9:19 AM

I stare at my phone for a long moment, then sigh, putting it down on the kitchen counter. Katie’s been talking about nothing else. She’s already looking at baby names. I suppose we should… discuss logistics. When would you be available?
